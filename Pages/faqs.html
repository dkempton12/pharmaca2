    <h2>Email &amp; Account Information</h2>
    <p><a name="account-login"></a><strong>Q: Why can&rsquo;t I log into my account?</strong></p>
    <p>A: If you&rsquo;re unable to successfully log into your account, ensure you&rsquo;re inputting your email address and password correctly. Check to make sure the Caps Lock key is not enabled before typing your password as passwords are case sensitive. It is best to type in all characters rather than use the copy and paste function.</p>
    <p>If you have forgotten your password, enter the email address used when you opened your account and select &ldquo;Email Password&rdquo;. You may need to answer a security question. A temporary password will be sent to your email address. It may take 15 minutes for your system-generated password to arrive. Please check your spam/junk mail folder for this email if it does not appear in your in-box. Please type the new password exactly as it appears with no additional spaces.</p>
    <p><strong>We highly recommend logging in with your temporary password immediately and changing it to something you will remember.</strong> You may do so by selecting &ldquo;Change My Password or Username&rdquo; on the top left of your account page.</p>

    <p><a name="credit-authorizations"></a><strong>A note about credit and debit card authorizations</strong></p>
    <p>Adjusted orders that have a higher balance than the original order will create new authorizations. Your financial institution will hold the amount of funds required to cover the total of the original order plus the total of the new order, not the difference between the two totals. If you are using a debit card please be sure you have enough funds to cover both orders. This is also true of authorizations for credit cards.</p>
    <p>The authorization for the order with the lower amount will expire within approximately seven business days, depending upon the procedures at your financial institution. For more information on authorizations and how long they will be in effect, please contact your financial institution.</p>

    <h2>Other Common Questions</h2>
    <p><a name="probiotics"></a><strong>Q: Do you ship probiotics under refrigeration? If not, will they be viable?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Our manufacturers formulate their probiotics to ensure their products retain viability until they reach the consumer. But we take extra care, ensuring that all probiotics remain refrigerated in the Pharmaca warehouse until the time of shipment; they are then packaged in an insulated envelope with an ice pack to further ensure potency in transit&mdash;at no extra charge. (Note: Ice pack will not arrive frozen/product will not arrive cold).</p>
    <p>Additionally, probiotic manufacturers add extra colony forming units (CFUs) to adjust for the product being shipped unrefrigerated, even in the summer months, and for it being unrefrigerated for several weeks. To ensure potency, the CFU count on the package is lower per dose than the actual count at the time of production. The CFU count is valid through the expiration date, even after the package is opened. For long-term storage, the product should be refrigerated.</p>
    <p>About different probiotic types:</p>
    <div><b>Shelf-stable probiotics</b><dl>are room-temperature stable and do not require refrigeration. Refrigeration will, however, extend the shelf life. Avoid temperatures above 77&deg;F (25&deg;C).</dl></div>
    <div><b>Saccharomyces Boulardii</b><dl>does not require refrigeration and can be stored at room temperature. Refrigeration will, however, extend the shelf life. Avoid temperatures above 77&deg;F (25&deg;C).</dl></div>
    <div><b>Non-shelf stable probiotics</b><dl>are room-temperature stable, but should be refrigerated for full therapeutic effect and extended shelf life. Avoid temperatures above 77&deg;F (25&deg;C).</dl></div>

    <p><a name="proposition-65"></a><strong>Q: What is Proposition 65?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Consumable products purchased in California may contain the message: &ldquo;This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive harm.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>This warning is required by Proposition 65, a California law that says products must be labeled if they potentially contain certain chemicals. Many of these chemicals are widely distributed throughout our environment in air, soil and water, making them common in foods, and consequently, some supplements, even if they aren&rsquo;t intentionally added.</p>
    <p>Proposition 65 standards are among the most strict in the country, and far exceed federal standards for safety. For example, Proposition 65 requires warnings for lead at 0.5 mcg per day&mdash;a much stricter amount than standards at the federal and international level.</p>
    <p>The bottom line is that this warning is simply a precaution, and does not necessarily mean the product is unsafe. Customers are encouraged to reach out to product manufacturers over ingredient concerns related to Proposition 65.</p>
