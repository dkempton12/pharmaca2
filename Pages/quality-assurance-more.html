<h1>More about our Quality Assurance Practices</h1>
<p>Pharmaca requires that all suppliers of dietary supplements and homeopathic medicines verif y their quality assurance practices
    according to our Vendor Quality Assurance Practice Standards (VQAP). Verification can be done through an on-site audit
    done by Pharmaca staff, or proof that an independent third party cGMP program has audited the manufacturer in the last
    12 months. Re-verification is necessary every three to five years, depending on VQAP compliance.</p>

                    <li>potency (when applicable)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use of most appropriate testing methodologies when testing for identity, microbiologicals, heavy metals, pesticides/herbicides
                (for botanicals), aflatoxins, melamine and residual solvents</li>
            <li>All methodologies will be compendia methods and/or scientifically valid methods</li>
