                <h3>Herb Pharm Better Bitters </h3>
                <p>“A proper functioning digestive system is foundational for health. That’s why I take and recommend bitters to anyone who is having digestive disturbances, such as indigestion, gas, bloating, heartburn, poor absorption, etc. Taken 10-15 minutes before meals, bitters stimulate and enhance the digestive “juices,” including stomach acid, bile and enzymes. These components are essential for breaking down and absorbing nutrients. There are also beneficial bacteria and other botanicals in this formula that soothe, heal and balance the digestive tract.”</p>

                <p>“I love these drops! I take them on a daily basis to provide my body with the minerals that are lacking in our food supply, including magnesium. Humans, animals and plants cannot create minerals, so they have to come from the soil. But because of modern farming and agricultural practices, studies have shown that our foods have a lower mineral content today than they did 50 years ago. That’s why I make sure I take them regularly to support optimal functioning of my body.”</p>

                <h3>Restore Complete Gut Well-Being</h3>
                <p>"The new future of ‘restoring’ gut health is here with this unique signaling molecule product. It’s not a probiotic, prebiotic, enzymes or minerals. It is stabilized signaling molecules that restore communication between your cells and the bacteria in your gut, enabling your body to heal. I highly recommended it for those with Leaky Gut and unbalanced gut flora to counter our universal exposure to glyphosate (a pesticide)."</p>

                <h3>Garden of Life MCT Oil</h3>
                <p>"After being introduced to this medium-chain triglyceride oil, I’m hooked! I take 1 tbsp every morning, either straight or mixed in a protein smoothie. I notice a remarkable increase in mental energy for the entire day, even late into the day. I highly recommended for those who are feeling fatigued, mentally and physically, or have difficulty concentrating. It’s not just a liquid coconut oil, it’s concentrated MCT oil from a really clean, pure source with the right types of MCTs to eliminate unwanted side effects and maximize benefits."</p>

                <p>"Trilogy is one of my favorite skin care lines to recommend to customers. It’s suitable for all skin types, even sensitive skin, and helps with regeneration, wrinkle reduction, scars, stretch marks and strengthening and nourishing the skin. I like that their Rosehip Oil is well researched, extremely pure and has lots of versatility for use topically either straight or mixed with other facial/body care formulas. A little goes a long way!"</p>

                <p>"It’s a simple device, but the most spine-tingling and relaxing experiences for your scalp! It’s not often we give our scalp a good massage and it’s time to show it some love. Massaging the scalp helps with increasing blood flow, which encourages healthy hair and skin growth. It can be used to self-massage, but feels even better if you can get someone else to do it!"</p>
