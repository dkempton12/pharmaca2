                <h3>Pharmaca Lung and Sinus Blaster</h3>
                <p>"This is the best throat spray I’ve ever found. It’s an intense blend of immune-boosting herbs such as goldenseal, horseradish root, garlic, cayenne, elderberry, olive leaf, echinacea and others. The taste is strong but that's why it works! I use this during cold and flu season constantly to fend off sore throats, swollen glands and congested sinuses. Take this when you first feel that funny tingle in your throat and you'll be happy you did!"</p>

                <h3>Garden of LIfe Vitamin Code Multivitamins</h3>
                <p>"When I do vitamin reviews I always recommend everyone first be on a multivitamin, because eating healthy just doesn’t cut it in the world we live in. A good multivitamin is the best way to fill in the nutrient gaps we are not getting in our food. My favorite is Garden of Life because the vitamins and minerals are all plant based and easily recognized by the body. I particularly like Garden of LIfe's Raw One for Women and Men because it’s in capsule form and only needs to be taken once a day. A good multivitamin such as this one should be the foundation of your regimen."</p>

                <h3>Pure Encapsulations Colostrum</h3>
                <p>"Colostrum is my go-to immunity supplement, especially for anyone that has been immunocompromised from viruses such as Epstein-Barr or shingles. I had mono in college and now still have the Epstein-Barr virus so I stay on colostrum year round to keep my immune system strong to avoid relapses. Colostrum is a highly concentrated source of powerful immune and growth factors that are the first mammary secretions that mammals provide their newborns before their immune systems develop. Colostrum is also beneficial for muscle growth, energy, GI support and modulating inflammation. I like Pure Encapsulations because it is high quality, coming from bovine colostrum and 40% Immunoglobulin IgG."</p>

                <h3>Enzymedica Serragold</h3>
                <p>"Serragold contains several proteolytic enzymes and a high amount of the enzyme serrapeptase (100,000 units). Serrapeptase is simply amazing—when taken on empty stomach, 1 hour before and 2 hours after a meal, the enzyme will literally break down and digest anything in your body that isn’t living tissue, such as inflammation, plaque, dead tissue and even parasites. I recommend this product to anyone dealing with inflammation, joint issues and even sinus issues. When I have blocked sinuses, I take it at night and wake up breathing through my nose again!"</p>

                <h3>Wishgarden Emotional Ally</h3>
                <p>"My favorite mood supplement. It’s great for the winter blues, PMS, or just lifting your mood when you feel down or flat. I typically feel it within 10-20 minutes after a few droppers full. It includes several mood-supportive herbs, including St. John's wort, motherwort, passionflower and skullcap, but doesn't have a strong herbal taste due to added vegetable glycerine."</p>

                <h3>Plantiva AllerDX</h3>
                <p>"AllerDX is a must during allergy season or for people with pet dander allergies. I experience both and find this works within 15 minutes. Before I go to someone’s house where there are animals, I always take this and it usually keeps my allergic reactions from surfacing or to a minimum."</p>

                <h3>Femmenessence Macaharmony</h3>
                <p>"I love maca and think everyone should take it to negate the hormone mimickers and disruptors we encounter that wreak havoc on our delicate hormonal balance. Maca is an adaptogenic root native to Peru that supports hormonal balance, which is important for our mood, weight management, fertility and even bone density. I particularly like this version because they spent 15 years on research before putting it on the market. In their research they were able to learn about 13 different types of maca that feature various colors, DNA, active ingredient amounts and, most importantly, what effect each type has. Look for other maca products from this brand, including for all stages of a woman’s life, and one for men, too."</p>
