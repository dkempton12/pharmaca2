                <h3>Pharmaca Echinamide</h3>
                <p>"One of my favorite products for immune support is still Echinamide and I have been using it for years. It is a highly researched and tested item that boasts consistency as a standardized echinacea. It is considered a “full spectrum” herb that contains high levels of three specific compounds (including polysaccharides) that are effective individually but when combined together have an exponentially stronger effect."</p>

                <h3>Pharmaca Ashwagandha</h3>
                <p>"Ashwaganda is an incredible adaptogen from India and is used for a multitude of symptoms and disorders. It’s amazing because it has a calming nervine function, unlike many other adaptogenic herbs which may have a stimulative effect. I like to take it in the afternoon as it will give me focus but also a relaxing energy which is hard to find. It is great for endocrine and adrenal support—and for many other conditions for both men and women."</p>

                <h3>Host Defense Agarikon</h3>
                <p>"I take this daily. It is made by an eco-conscious company based in Olympia, Wash. that has done a lot of research on the mycelium (root system) of mushrooms. The Agarikon is very nutritive and tonifying, which will help give a boost to all of your body’s systems. You only need to take it once a day."</p>

                <p>"Hawthorne is helpful with most anything heart-related as it relaxes the musculature of the heart. I went through a period of my life when I had severe chest pains and tried everything from swimming, yoga, Rolfing and chiropractic to reduce the pain. As soon as I started taking hawthorne, I could feel the tension in my body relax and the pain disappeared almost immediately. These are amazing products!"</p>
