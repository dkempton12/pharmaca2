                <h3>Neuroscience Kavinace Ultra PM</h3>
                <p>"I love this product for customers that have tried everything to help them sleep but nothing seems to be working. Kavinace features a form of GABA that can cross the blood-brain barrier, helping calm the repetitive thoughts that some people get before falling asleep."</p>

                <h3>Thorne Research Meriva</h3>
                <p>"I love Meriva because it uses a form of turmeric that can be easily absorbed. Turmeric is difficult to absorb and customers that use Meriva often see a greater benefit in their symptoms compared to customers using other turmeric products."</p>

                <h3>Garden of Life Dr. Formulated Probiotics </h3>
                <p>"Garden of Life worked with Dr. David Perlmutter to formulate this great line of probiotics. Each formulation contains a variety of strains and at higher potency.

                <h3>Gaia Herbs Adrenal Jump Start</h3>
                <p>"I really like to recommend this formula for customers that feel tired and run down from acute or chronic stress. It’s only meant to be taken for 6-8 weeks, but it really helps your body recover. After the 6-8 weeks some customers follow with a daily adrenal supplement like Gaia’s Adrenal Daily support if they feel they need more assistance."</p>

                <h3>Triphala</h3>
                <p>"I like Gaia Herbs or Organic India brands of triphala, which is an ancient Ayurvedic blend of three fruits that help nourish and detoxify the body. Triphala is very useful for customers that have sluggish digestion, because it promotes peristalsis (the progressive contraction of the smooth muscles in the intestines that helps move waste from the body). Triphala can be an important addition for those doing a detox protocol or anyone wanting daily elimination support."</p>
