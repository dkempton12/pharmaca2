                <p>“This is one of the best mineral sunscreens on the market. It's reef safe (meaning it doesn’t contribute to the degradation of coral reefs like chemical-based sunscreens do) and it scores a 1 (top score) on the Environmental Working Group's assessment. It absorbs quickly and easily, so you don't look white as a ghost while you're out enjoying the sun.”</p>

                <h3>Ortho Molecular Natural D-Hist</h3>
                <p>“More and more we are seeing increases in allergy symptoms. Mast cells, which are a subtype of white blood cells, are responsible for releasing histamine, which causes sneezing, itching, rash and wheezing symptoms. But these mast cells release other chemokines and inflammatory molecules. D-Hist is an incredible product because of how well it stabilizes those mast cells and prevents the release of the histamine and those other cell protein markers responsible for symptoms—without causing drowsiness.”</p>

It's a blend of L-theanine (an amino acid) and GABA (a brain neurotransmitter) that help instill some calm in an otherwise hectic mind. I like using it during the day, when it seems like there is too much stress going on."</p>

                <p>“A majority of people experience mineral deficiencies or inadequacies in the US. These drops are a balanced formula of minerals and trace elements required for all of our body's functions, from the cellular level upward. If you’re using a reverse-osmosis water filter, distilled water or purified water, I would recommend putting these in your water every day to remineralize it. This is especially helpful for athletes or those who exercise regularly. I also loved that it's US-sourced, certified vegan, and gluten free.”</p>
