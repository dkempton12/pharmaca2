                <h3>Genuine Health Fast Joint Care+</h3>
                <p>"This is one of my top go-to products to address joint pain and stiffness due to osteoarthritis. The two ingredients are natural eggshell membrane (NEM) and fermented turmeric. Naturally occurring glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronic acid and type I collagen are just some of the nutrients that are provided by the NEM. These nutrients help to build joint cartilage as well as reduce pain and inflammation. The turmeric provides additional anti-inflammatory support. The dosing is only 2 capsules a day and I find that many people experience positive results much sooner than by taking these nutrients separately."</p>

                <h3>Avène Thermal Spring Water</h3>
                <p>"I always keep a large bottle of this on hand. The naturally occurring minerals, amino acids and trace elements work together to soften, soothe and calm the skin. I use it year ‘round to hydrate my skin, set mineral makeup and to enhance the absorption of serums after cleansing. It is a staple in the summertime, especially for the kiddos, for relieving itch from insect bites, soothing the occasional sunburn and cooling off from the heat."</p>

                <h3>Pharmaca Lung and Sinus Blaster</h3>
                <p>"This is a highly effective formula for addressing sinus congestion from colds, allergies and infection. The combination of aromatic, antimicrobial and immune-supportive herbs work to open the passageways, ease breathing and relieve the pressure created by the congestion. It is a pungent formula which is part of what makes it so work so well. If one is willing and able, I suggest holding the dose under the tongue for a few seconds to allow those vapors to enter into the sinuses. Once you get past the initial (and short-lasting) intensity you will find that the comfort and healing it brings is well worth it."</p>

                <h3>Alaffia Everyday Shea Bubble Baths</h3>
                <p>"Alaffia is an amazing company and I continue to find more and more products of theirs that I adore. I chose to highlight the bubble baths because it is one of the few that I have found to be truly moisturizing to my skin. When my daughter started asking for bubbles in her bath I looked at many ingredient labels to find one that I liked. Not only did these look good on paper, they delivered just what I was hoping for. They also have a ‘Babies &amp; Up’ line, with fun scents like Coconut Strawberry and Lemon Lavender, as well as an unscented. The shea butter and coconut oil is ethically traded and the company is both Fair Trade and Fair for Life certified."</p>

                <h3>O.N.E. Multivitamin by Pure Encapsulations</h3>
                <p>"For those customers looking for a one-a-day multivitamin, I often recommend this one. I like that the vitamins and minerals come in highly bioavailable forms, which means the body is going to use them more efficiently. It also contains a handful of antioxidants, including CoQ10 which is important for providing support to all of the cells in the body, in particular the cardiovascular system. It’s easy to take and I find that most people do quite well with it, especially if they have not tolerated other multivitamins. O.N.E. is also hypo-allergenic and certified gluten-free."</p>
