    <h1>Our commitment to accessibility</h1>
    <p>To date, there is no specific language in the Americans with Disabilities Act regarding websites, but at Pharmaca we&rsquo;re committed to accessibility, diversity and inclusion. It is our goal that all of our guests should be able to easily shop online at pharmaca.com.</p>
    <p>That's why we are in the process of making pharmaca.com accessible to those using assistive technologies like a screen reader, a magnifier or voice recognition software. Our end goal is to make Pharmaca everyone's preferred shopping destination for wellness and natural beauty products. </p>
    <p>While we continue making accessibility improvements, feel free to reach out to us if you need help or want to provide feedback. You may either:</p>
