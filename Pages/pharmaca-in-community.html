<h2>Local Initiatives</h2>
<p>Each December Pharmaca stores facilitate a Holiday Gift Bag Donation program, offering customers an opportunity to purchase much-needed wellness products that are hand-picked for a chosen charity in each store&rsquo;s community. Those charities can range from women&rsquo;s shelters to halfway houses to YMCAs. In 2016, across 29 stores, Pharmaca was able to deliver more than $112,000 worth of wellness goods to needy charities.</p>

<p>Since 2004, Pharmaca has been a proud partner of Vitamin Angels, a non-profit organization that raises funds to help at-risk populations in need&ndash;specifically pregnant women, new mothers and children under 5&ndash;gain access to life saving and life-changing micronutrients. Donations to Vitamin Angels go toward distribution of prenatal vitamins, vitamin A and children&rsquo;s multivitamins, which help increase immunity and boost overall health to increase these populations&rsquo; chances for health and success.</p>
<p>In addition to the Vitamin Angels donations cards always available at the register (ask a Pharmaca Team Member if you can&rsquo;t find them), Pharmaca runs several special promotions each year to encourage customer donations. We&rsquo;re proud to say that through the generosity of our customers, over the years we have been able to donate more than $78,000, reaching 82,873 children and adults in the US and 49 other countries. We hope that you&rsquo;ll help us contribute to our growing contribution next time you&rsquo;re at a Pharmaca store!</p>
