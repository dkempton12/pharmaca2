                <p>Bottega Organica's 100% organic, all-natural skin care concept was born in 2013 from Dr. Alimonti’s pivotal scientific discovery on the powerful ant-aging effects of salvia haenkei.</p>

                <p>Dr. Andrea Alimonti, a world-renowned geneticist, screened thousands of different plants for their ability to maintain human cells in a youthful state. He was ultimately able to identify a handful of plant extracts with intense anti-aging action, but salvia haenkei, also known as prawn sage, was by far the most active extract—and is now the backbone of the Bottega Organica skin care line.</p>
                <p>Dr. Alimonti’s research on salvia haenkei is published in the December 2016 issue of the US scientific journal Aging, in an article entitled Identification of Salvia haenkei as gerosuppressant agent by using an integrated senescence-screening assay.</p>

                <p><i>“The most potent of these hits was an extract of Salvia haenkei (SH), a member of the family of Salvias, native of Bolivia. SH decreased senescence by 50%…”</i></p> 

                <p>Everything that goes into Bottega Organica products is well-researched and meticulously crafted. All Bottega Organica ingredients are harvested and processed naturally from farms in Italy—straight from farm to bottle. You won’t find any preservatives, emulsifiers, artificial fragrances, colors or synthetics of any kind.</p>

                <h3>Bottega Organica Activate Serum</h3>
                <p>"Glow serum: My skin is glowing after 2 weeks of use. I love the products from this line. Simple yet effective, making it great for sensitive skin but also results oriented. Mild scent, absorbs well to allow layering of other products."<br />
                <i>- Customer from Huntersville, NC</i></p>

                <hr />
                <h3>Bottega Organica Ageless Face Mist</h3>
                <p>"This stuff is Awesome: I really see and feel a difference using this mist. My skin is more hydrated, does not leave any residue just makes your skin look nicer and younger! I use many different products, skincare junkie, and this is a keeper. You can easily add this to any regimen and get a nice little boost of anti oxidants and moisture! Not a strong scent at all, just natural pleasant scent then dissipates.<br />
                <i>Customer from Fountain Valley, CA</i></p>

                <p>"This is an unbelievable skincare line. I have developed a mild case of Rosacea since having my kids and this stuff heals any redness and soothes in unison more so than any overpriced prescription from a dermatologist. I highly recommend these products, and I am extremely picky. My husband has also been a chemical engineer and helped in developing major skincare lines such as Estee Lauder and Aveda and after looking at the ingredients this line embodies he gave his blessing it is very effective."<br />
                <i>Online Customer</i></p>

                <p>"Love it. Best I ever used. This stuff is luxurious and super worth it. It makes my skin soft and glowy and keep my skin hydrated. I usually have skin allergies but Bottega Organica ingredients are naturally processed no preservatives or synthetic materials. 100% organic I definitely recommend all the products."<br />

                <p>"What a find! Effective balms &amp; oils with seductive scents and slick packaging. My new obsession."<br />
