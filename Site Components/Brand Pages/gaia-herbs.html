            <p>Twenty-five years ago, Gaia Herbs was founded by Ric Scalzo, who still leads the company as President and CEO. As a privately held company, Gaia Herbs remains committed to a vision of Purity, Integrity &amp; Potency, which drives how they run their business.<br />
            <strong>Gaia Herbs' Core Values:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Vis Medicatrix Naturae</i>: Cooperate with the healing powers of nature</li>
                <li>Do no harm to plants, animals or humans</li>
                <li>Always remain holistic, addressing formative causes in formulation</li>
                <li>Teach and market in a positive and spirited manner</li>
                <li>Validate beliefs with objective scientific data</li>
                <li>Know, honor and uphold the laws of nature, as well as industry laws</li>
                <li>Purity, Integrity &amp; Potency, in products and message, from seed to shelf</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Purity + Integrity = Potency</strong><br />
            Gaia Herbs believes that working in accordance with the virtues of harmony is as important as what they produce. Gaia Herbs holds itself&mdash;and everything they produce&mdash;accountable to the virtues of purity, integrity and potency.</p>
            <p><i>Purity.</i> Each herb must be cultivated in accordance with nature's intent.<br />
            <i>Integrity.</i> Herbal medicines must be created to ensure the fullest possible expression of each herb.<br />
            <i>Potency.</i> It is only through their commitment to purity and integrity that they can deliver the powerful effects of each herb.</p>
            <p><strong>Gaia Farm: A Living Laboratory</strong><br />
            Gaia Farm is the only farm of its kind with an on-site, state-of-the-art laboratory and processing facility. Both are located on 250 acres of the Blue Ridge Mountains of western North Carolina, one of the most diverse bioregions in North America.</p>
            <img class="pull-left" alt="A Living Labratory" src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/gaia-herbs/about/brand-pages-gaia-herbs-about2.jpg" />
            <p>In Gaia's fields, laboratory and production facility, the company studies, observes and learns from nature. They apply those lessons to both growing the highest-quality herbs possible and in facilitating the delivery of herbal bioactive constituents to the people who need them.</p>

            <p>Gaia's commitment to purity, integrity and potency starts with the soil through comprehensive organic fertility standards. Plants and seeds are selected only from sources whose organic methods and plant quality can be verified. Then they observe the plants as they grow from seedling to maturity, learning their unique life cycles, using analytical testing to measure bioactivity levels and harvesting only when peak levels have been reached.</p>

            <p>The same level of care is applied when herbs enter production in their facility for transformation into herbal supplements. All herbs are validated by rigid purity standards for sourcing and processed with the highest level of integrity. Our careful extraction and concentration methods produce extracts of high potency.</p>

            <p><strong>Liquid Phyto-Caps</strong><br />
            Gaia Herbs' line of Liquid Phyto-Caps contain multi-herb formulas, as well as single ingredient herbs. This patented delivery system, developed exclusively by Gaia Herbs, offers the power of a liquid extract with the convenience of an easily digestible, quick-dissolving capsule.</p>
