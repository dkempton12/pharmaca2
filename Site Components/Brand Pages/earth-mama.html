            <p><b>Mama's standards</b><br />
            Product safety is the highest priority at Earth Mama HQ. Every product is made with only natural, organic and worry-free ingredients. They continually refine products as organic ingredients or more efficient herbs become available.</p>

            <p><b>Clinically tested, certified organic, Non-GMO Verified</b><br />
            If Earth Mama makes a claim, they back it up with honest, clear labels. Their organic products are certified by Oregon Tilth, and GMO-free products have been Non-GMO Project Verified. They’ve tested soaps for efficacy, and balms for irritants. It’s an extra step, but Earth Mama believes in third-party verification so consumers know exactly what they're buying.</p>

            <p><b>Research and education</b><br />
            Earth Mama’s mission is to constantly research, test and refine products, and educate people about the safe use of herbs and ingredients in their personal care products.</p>

            <p><b>Sustainability</b><br />
            Earth Mama believes in protecting all mothers, including Mother Earth. Earth Mama chooses green and toxin-free business practices because they have a company-wide commitment to honor the earth and her valuable resources. They even have a BRAG award for green business practices.</p>

            <p><b>What is Mama's Promise®?</b><br />
            Mama's promise is to offer only safe, pure, natural products that work. If it doesn’t measure up to Mama’s standards, it doesn’t leave the building. Promise.</p>

                    <p>"I have pretty much lathered myself up with this lotion day and night after every shower and bath since my belly started stretching at the beginning of this trimester. It smells so fresh and is lightweight and non-greasy. I love climbing into bed having coated my torso in its deliciousness! Plus I have not had any dry skin, stretch marks or night body itches so far, so it's definitely doing something right!!"<br />-Collette C.</p>

                    <p>"The Herbal Perineal Spray is an absolute must-have for any pregnant mama. I started using this in the hospital right after giving birth (and I mean right after!) and it's amazing how soothing and comforting it was. A quick spritz and there's immediate relief, not to mention all of the healing benefits it provides. And I love the fact that it applies with a gentle spray, so there's no need to irritate sensitive areas! Love, love, love it!"<br />

They have offered me relief before and after so many feedings. Not only was the cold or the hot a relief, but the smell was so comforting. I am planning to send all of my girlfriends a set when I find out they are pregnant. Thank you so much for a wonderful product!"<br />
