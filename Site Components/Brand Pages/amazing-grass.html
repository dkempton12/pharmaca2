                <p>Amazing Grass Organic Wheat Grass is one of the most potent leafy greens on Earth, not to mention a great source of vitamins and minerals.

                <p>Amazing Grass grows its wheat grass at a family-run farm in Kansas, where it’s harvested at its nutritional peak just prior to the jointing stage, when they cut just the tip of the leaf–the most nutrient-rich part of the plant. This process ensures they capture and lock in the potent nutrition that Mother Nature intended, and allows the body to easily recognize, absorb and assimilate these amazing superfoods.</p>
