            <p>Natural Factors is one of the industry leaders in organic farming, sourcing and development of raw materials, research and development, quality control and quality assurance. With hundreds of acres of farmland in the fertile valleys of central British Columbia, Natural Factors cultivates a variety of medicinal crops for research as well as production. The company strives for the highest level of vertical integration, bringing as many processes in-house as possible, for maximum quality assurance and 100 percent control over the end product. Their manufacturing capabilities include tableting, soft gel and hard gel encapsulation and packaging, as well as organic farming of herbs.</p>
