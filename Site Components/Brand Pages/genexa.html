            </div>
            <p>Genexa is the world’s first line of USDA Certified Organic and Non-GMO Project Verified homeopathic medicines for children and adults. Genexa was founded on the belief that medicine should not only be effective and unquestionably safe, but that it should be healthy, too.</p>

            <p>Genexa is revolutionizing medicine by removing harsh, synthetic ingredients commonly found in remedies and replacing them with cleaner, healthier ingredients.</p>

            <h3>A medicine you can trust</h3>
            <p>Genexa is devoted to making medicine healthier, from sourcing the highest quality ingredients and using extensive research to formulate the most effective medicines to compliance with FDA and regulatory guidelines.</p>

            <h3>Committed to USDA Organic ingredients</h3>
            <p>Genexa is dedicated to being a certified USDA Organic company, which means all their medicines are made from certified organic ingredients and are rigorously tested through a highly audited process that examines the entire supply chain. This ensures Genexa products are free of toxins and unhealthy ingredients, including pesticides and artificial fillers, so they can commit to truly making medicine healthy.</p>

            <h3>A proud Non-GMO Verified company</h3>
            <p>Most medicines are full of potentially harmful genetically modified ingredients like lactose, corn syrup and flavorings derived from high-risk ingredients. Genexa prides themselves on sourcing only non-GMO ingredients. Each ingredient is transported separately and audited along the way to make sure integrity is maintained throughout the process.</p>

            <h3>Spread the Health</h3>
            <p>As a Certified B Corporation, Genexa we want to do our part to help make the world a healthier place. Their Spread the Health initiative was created to provide health services for kids in need. For each product purchased, Genexa donates to charitable organization focused on children’s health.</p>

            <p>"Genexa has great products. If I feel a cold coming on, I take Genexa. My wife and kids all got sick recently, and I started taking Genexa. I was able to not only help them, but I stayed healthy as well!! Great work! And the products are tasty as well."<br />

            <p>"This company and their products are so inspiring. Very happy to support a company that is all about being completely natural and organic, but also the backstory as well. I was recently diagnosed with a disorder and have a very hard time taking any type of medicine, but have had trouble sleeping lately. I think I have found my solution until I can get my schedule back on track! What makes this great is that it won't interfere with the other medications I now have to take daily."<br />
