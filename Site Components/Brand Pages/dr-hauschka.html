                <h3>Company History</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Born in 1891 in Austria, chemist Dr. Rudolf Hauschka's great passion was exploring the big questions of life, such as What is it to be?, What is matter? and What is energy? Upon meeting renowned philosopher Dr. Rudolf Steiner, Dr. Hauschka asked the educator the ultimate question: "What is life?"</p>    
                <img class="pull-left" src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/dr-hauschka/DrHauschka_DayCareModel.jpg" alt="Dr. Hauschka Model Image">
                <p>Dr. Steiner's response came in the form of a mission: "Study rhythm," he said, "Rhythm carries life." Inspired by these words, Dr. Hauschka looked anew at the life and energy of the natural world and saw the presence and influence of rhythm in all living things.</p>
                <p>With the goal of harnessing the plant world's healing capabilities in effective natural medicines, Dr. Rudolf Hauschka conducted a rhythm-based experiment. He exposed rose petals to the natural polarities of warmth and cold, light and darkness, and motion and stillness, and discovered that through a unique process of "rhythmical processing" he was able to create a water-based rose extract that remained stable for more than 30 years.</p>
                <p>Using this rhythmical processing method, Dr. Hauschka began creating botanically based medicines.</p>
                <p>In 1935, as his work progressed, Dr. Hauschka and colleagues founded the holistic pharmaceutical company WALA Heilmittel with the mission "to support the healing of humanity and the earth." WALA began the manufacture of plant- and mineral-based medicines. "WALA" is an acronym for the process by which Dr. Hauschka developed his rhythmical processing method: Warmth, Ash, Light, Ash.</p>
                <p>In the 1950s, WALA Heilmittel established its own biodynamic garden to provide ingredients for its products&mdash;a garden that thrives to this day, providing botanical ingredients for WALA's medicines as well as Dr. Hauschka Skin Care.</p>
                <p>In the early 1960s, esthetician Elisabeth Sigmund recognized the power of rhythm and traditional herbs in guiding skin to a healthy, beautiful state. She was also very interested in the role the lymphatic system played in skin health. Ms. Sigmund found that incorporating some of Dr. Hauschka's plant-based medicines into her skin care treatments proved highly effective and she wrote Dr. Hauschka to share her results. This sparked a collaboration to develop a line of holistic skin care products and methods, and in 1967, Dr. Hauschka Skin Care was introduced.</p>
                <p>In 1969, Elisabeth Sigmund introduced her unique treatment methods to the WALA community, developing the Dr. Hauschka Classic Treatment, the basis for all Dr. Hauschka Signature Treatments to come.</p>
                <p>Today, Dr. Hauschka Skin Care includes more than 50 products for the face, body, bath and hair, as well as decorative cosmetics, and is sold in more than 40 countries internationally.</p>
