                <h3>PHILOSOPHY</h3>
                <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/evanhealy/evanhealy-about-1.jpg" class="pull-right" alt="a flower in a jar" />
                
                <p><strong>Less is more</strong></p>
                <p>The concept of “less is more” is consistently missed by a beauty industry fueled by the ingredient du jour. By pairing organic ingredients with non-invasive treatment methods, Evan’s holistic philosophy supports the totality of skin functions, encouraging the skin’s inherent ability to breathe.</p>
                
                <p>When you use products that have been made from isolated, synthesized ingredients, you have removed all the magic, the alchemy. By doing this, you have eliminated the sometimes 1000s of essential supporting micronutrients. Essentially you’re working out of a test tube.</p>
                
                <p>“I developed evanhealy based on my experience that the less you interfere with the skin’s own ability to achieve balance, the better. I’ve taken my love of plants, and my experience of what works on the skin, and created a selection of simple plant-based skin care, that radically changes how women view their skin.” - Evan</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Skin Breathes<sup>&reg;</sup></strong></p>
                
                <p>It has a rhythm, an inhalation and an exhalation. It is made up of literally millions of tiny dermal passages regulating the inward movement of air, fluids, heat and light. In healthy skin, these passages are unobstructed, and each breath activates the absorption of nutritive substances and stimulates vital functions of a restorative nature. Unlike other products, evanhealy does not use synthetics that coat or cover the skin interfering with its own natural functions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Skin’s Protective Barrier</strong></p>
                <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/evanhealy/evanhealy-about-2.jpg" class="pull-left" alt="A woman being painted" />
                <p>Simply, here’s how the skin works: sweat glands and sebaceous glands work together to produce a thin coating of lipids (oil) and perspiration (water), called the acid mantle. The acid mantle is the skin’s protective barrier against disease. When the delicate balance of acidity and alkalinity that makes up the acid mantle is disrupted, the skin’s ability to protect is weakened. Evanhealy uses the oils and waters of the plant kingdom to help restore the skin’s natural balance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Who you are is enough<sup>&reg;</sup></strong></p>
                <p>“Looking in someone’s face is a sacred affair.” To be beautiful is a commitment to one’s self. There comes a time when we have to look beyond the mundane, to stop critical thoughts and pinpointing ridiculous details and move toward acceptance. Anti-aging goes against nature. You can hold your finger in the dike only so long before the dam breaks. But feeling beautiful is something you can do at any age. By realigning ourselves with nature and its rhythms, and drawing inspiration from the ways of our ancestors, we bring our bodies back into balance and our minds and spirits into a reverent peace.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <h3>Handcrafted and certified organic</h3> 
                <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/evanhealy/evanhealy-ingredients-1.jpg" alt="Hands open palm up" class="pull-right">
                <p>evanhealy relies on certified organic and wild-crafted plants, mineral-rich clays and sustainable harvesting practices. All oil serums and hydrosols are certified organic by Oregon Tilth, the foremost certifying body in the USA. Each step of evanhealy’s production is done by hand. From the fields and forests where the plants that become hydrosols, oils and butters are harvested, to their production facility where they hand-blend formulas, hand-label and hand-package each bottle. Maintaining this intimate connection with plants elevates the efficacy and therapeutic benefits they provide. It keeps the profound prana of the plant alive and well, so that by the time the bottle is in your hand, it’s still bursting with vitality. A vitality you can smell, feel and see on the skin.</p>
                
                <h3>HydroSouls, sourced from family farms</h3>
                <p>Since 2007 evanhealy has sourced its HydroSouls from a small group of certified organic artisan distillers based in the Columbia River Valley in northeastern Washington State. After a global search, it is here evanhealy found the most exquisitely crafted plant waters available.</p>
                
                <p>evanhealy’s HydroSouls are distilled specifically for the hydrosol, ensuring that the most therapy is extracted from the plant. These plant waters restore proper pH to the skin, keeping it slightly acidic. They plump, hydrate and help anchor moisture from various oils, butters and creams deeper into the skin when used together. Each brings unique properties and benefits to the skin. Use morning, evening and throughout the day to bring suppleness, hydration and vital luminescence to the skin. In addition to using them individually, they are also key ingredients in our cleansers and moisturizers. </p>

                <h3>Al Amal Co-operative argan oil</h3>
                <p>evanhealy has purchased its argan oil exclusively from women’s co-operatives since they began working with it a handful of years ago. evanhealy began by purchasing from a collective of 22 women’s co-operatives called the UCFA. Over time, they identified the argan oil from one specific co-operative within the UCFA as the most exquisite. That co-operative is Al Amal. From that time forward, Al Amal has been the sole producer of the hand-pressed, certified organic argan oil used in so many evanhealy products.</p>
                
                <p><i>Note: The majority of argan oil sold in the skin care industry today is mass-produced by private companies often claiming association with women’s co-operative without evidence. According to BEFAIR, the Belgian Development Agency, less than 10% of the Argan oil exported from Morocco today is made by women’s co-operatives.</i></p>

                <h3>Kpersi Village Shea Butter</h3>
                <p>evanhealy’s Certified Organic and “Fair for Life” Fair Trade shea butter comes exclusively from the women of Kpersi Village in northern Ghana. Their exquisitely rich and nourishing butter is the star of evanhealy’s Whipped Shea Butters, and also graces their cleansers and moisturizers. It was Evan’s visit to the village in 2014 that inspired her to deepen our relationship with these women, and find more ways of supporting them, their families and their village. evanhealy began by purchasing school uniforms for all the children of the village (in this region, a child cannot attend school unless they have a uniform). Next, they purchased a new grinding mill for the village, which is essential to the production of shea butter, and for processing food for the village. After that they co-funded both Organic Certification and their Fair Trade Certification for the village’s shea butter.</p>
                
                <h3>Whole essential oils</h3> 
                <p>evanhealy believes in holistic therapy. When it comes to creating skin care products, they opt for the complexity of whole plant wisdom by using the complete essential oil, not an isolated molecule. While it might be tempting to use an isolate for its consistency of fragrance or low cost, evanhealy believes that variations in the fragrance profile of an essential oil reflect the biodiversity of the land on which the plant was grown. An isolate is not aromatherapy. It does not include the 100s of complex aromatic molecules that exist within an essential oil.</p>
                
                <p>evanhealy believes in the potential of the whole essential oil for the whole person. They source their certified organic essential oils from a few select distilleries and a European-based farm co-operative, whose members stretch from Madagascar and Sri Lanka, to Nepal, Egypt and South Africa, and throughout Europe.</p>

                <p>Evan Healy’s ultra-pure skin care line—well-loved by Pharmaca estheticians—starts with the earth’s best ingredients and ends with efficacious formulas that support the skin’s natural processes. We chatted with Evan to learn about her unique philosophy.</p>

                <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/evanhealy/evanhealy-q-a-1.jpg" class="pull-right" alt="evan healy farming ingredients">
                <h3>HOW DID YOU GET YOUR START IN SKIN CARE?</h3>
                
                <p>After six years in the high fashion industry in San Francisco, I was ready for a change. So, in 1984 I moved from San Francisco to San Diego. I went from fashion to natural personal care, specifically holistic skin care—a field I knew absolutely nothing about.</p>
                <p>I focused on learning about skin care product ingredients. I learned to value organic ingredients over chemicals and synthetics. I championed the use of organically grown, biologically active, plant-based ingredients: essential oils, shea butters, natural clays, serums, plant milks and hydrosols. I requested that our manufacturers replace synthetic petro-chemicals with safer, more natural and organically grown alternatives.</p>
                <p>Eventually I developed a real love of skin health, and wanted to work more hands-on with people, so in 1986 I trained as an esthetician in the US, and then in Germany. Later I spent more time studying Ayurveda, aromatherapy and homeopathy in France, England and India.</p>
                <p>My core philosophy is founded on the premise that the less you interfere with the skin's own ability to achieve balance, the better. This holistic and naturopathic approach still challenges some of our society's fundamental beliefs relating to beauty, (anti) aging and care of the skin.</p>
                <p>Simplicity is what connects us to the natural world. Along the way I have learned to trust my intuition and to increasingly rely on and have respect for the rhythms of nature, and the traditional knowledge of indigenous cultures.</p>
                
                <h3>HOW DO YOU IDENTIFY NEW INGREDIENTS? WHERE DO YOU SOURCE THEM?</h3>
                
                <p>For me, it’s not as much about identifying a new ingredient, as it is in rediscovering, ‘unearthing’ ancient ones. Nature has always supplied us with an incredible bounty of truly therapeutic materials.</p>
                
                <p>For example, within rosehip seed oil there’s a compound called trans-retinoic-acid, which is a precursor to vitamin A. But it’s also got countless other compounds and co-factors. By using rosehip seed oil, you see nearly the same results as you would with a synthetic topical vitamin A, without any of the harsh side effects. Nature creates a perfect matrix.</p>
                
                <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/evanhealy/evanhealy-q-a-2.jpg" class="pull-left" alt="Evan Healy posing with an employee">
                <p>Oils, hydrosols, clay, shea butter—these naturally occurring raw materials are representative of a selection of traditional, ancient ingredient ‘basics,’ building blocks that have been used for 1000s of years to beautify and balance skin, and their effective, rejuvenating action on the skin has been well documented.</p>
                
                <p>This idea has a more substantial appeal to me than the over-hyped magical ingredient du jour: experimental extracts, chemically manipulated isolates, cosmeceutical or petrochemical synthetics to which the skin is unfamiliar. Intuitively, it made more sense to me to use substances that were compatible with the body’s physiology—substances that were environmentally sustainable, renewable and certified organic. I also prefer to package in glass.</p>
                <p>As humans, we’ve evolved and adapted right alongside the plant world, a world to which we are intimately connected via our senses of sight, scent, taste and touch.</p>
                <p>In short, we’re made for each other.</p>
                
                <p>We gain so much by returning to the wisdom and power of nature. It really is the only option for long-term, sustainable skin health. That’s something I’ve seen time and time again in the 30 years I’ve been working with skin.</p>
                <p>—-</p>
                <p>I’m really passionate about sourcing our ingredients.</p>
                <p>I believe it’s tremendously important to know where your ingredients are coming from. There’s so much adulteration in the aromatherapy business that it’s one of the only ways to truly know that what you’re purchasing is authentic.</p>
                <p>Still, for me that’s not enough. I don’t want to just know what farms our ingredients are from, I want to actively cultivate relationships with the people who are producing these remarkable plants.</p>
                
                <p>I’ve spent decades of my life seeking out the most incredible artisans I can find. Growers and producers who create small batches, are certified organic and have a genuine passion for what they’re doing. All of this contributes to creating ingredients that have superior therapeutic application and incomparable purity. Beyond incredible effects on the skin, this kind of sourcing empowers individuals and families over huge corporations.</p>
                <p>We source our ingredients from small family farms, tribal villages and women’s cooperatives. And many, if not most, of these are certified organic.</p>
                
                <h3>DO YOU HAVE ANY ENVIRONMENTAL OR COMMUNITY-FOCUSED INITIATIVES AS A COMPANY?</h3>
                
                <p>This question is actually difficult to answer because every avenue of my business aims to support the environment and our global community.</p>
                <p>From using certified organic plant material to recycled or compostable materials in our packaging and shipping, we make a conscious effort to be sustainable across our business. Everything is hand-bottled, hand-labeled and hand packaged. This helps retain the energetic vitality of the plant material.</p>
                <p>We also like to give back to the communities we work with. The shea butter we use in many of our products comes from a small village in northwestern Ghana called Kperisi, where the shea butter is traditionally harvested and handcrafted. At this point, we’ve supplied the children of the village with school uniforms (they can’t attend unless they have one), funded the building of a grinding mill for their community, and co-funded their organic and Fair Trade certification.</p>
                <p>In Morocco, we co-sponsored the planting of 400 argan sapling trees in a UNESCO-protected biosphere. The trees will mature within 6–8 years and bear the valuable fruit that sustains these women, their children and extended families.</p>
                
                <h3>WHAT DREW YOU TO PHARMACA AS A RETAILER?</h3>
                
                <p>Pharmaca represents the intersection between alternative and conventional medicine, and plays an innovative, integral role in the retail environment.</p>
                <p>As an esthetician, I value and appreciate Pharmaca’s emphasis on education and love that you staff your stores with estheticians, herbalists, pharmacists, nutritionists, etc. Through your team, you’re not only providing exceptional customer service, but also empowering your customers with information. That’s an important role in today’s retail environment.</p>
                
                <h3>YOUR SKIN LOOKS AMAZING! WHAT ARE YOUR EVANHEALY MUST HAVES FOR YOUTHFUL-LOOKING SKIN?</h3>
                
                <p>I have such a simple routine! In fact, of all the skin-related issues that are important to me, the one that I speak of the most often, is the concept of less is more. I use one of my Oil Serums twice a day AM+PM and I mist HydroSouls throughout the day. There is always one in my purse, on my desk or in my onboard travel kit. I don’t walk out the door without applying my Wild Carrot Eye Balm, and my Whipped Shea Butter for Lips is always in my purse or backpack.</p>
                
                <p>During my years in my skin care practice I experienced a few epiphanies. The most important one was about self-esteem and its relationship to beauty. I spent years listening to women speak about what they see as their facial imperfections, and recently read that only 2 percent of all women around the world consider themselves beautiful.</p>
                
                <p>But the truth is we are not separate from the beauty we seek. Beauty surrounds us.</p>
                <p>It's a bit like the Japanese concept of wabi sabi, that pared down to its essence is where the real beauty lies. It's to give voice to the thought that real beauty is never perfect, not elusive, but lies in the cracks and crevices of our lives every minute of the day.</p>
