                <p>"Vitamin C is all the rage lately. So I went on the hunt for the perfect product for me. I have sensitive skin and have tried a few products, which made my skin breakout. By far the Sonäge High Impact Vitamin C Serum has been the best. I put it on after my toner before my moisturizer. It's lightweight and was easily absorbed by my skin. My skin after two weeks of using it is noticeably different. My skin is brighter and healthier than ever. I've been wearing less makeup too because my skin looks so naturally beautiful! I highly recommend it!”<br />

                <p>"I've used Sonäge products for a few years, but the same few over and over. I read a review on the Vitamin C Serum and thought I'd try something new...I am now on my 3rd reorder of it and recommend it SO highly!! I used it first when I get out of the shower, then my daily moisturizer and it made such a difference in my skin tone throughout the day. I run very red and it's helped so much. Love it!!"<br />
