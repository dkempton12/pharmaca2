                <p>U•Konserve was started in 2008 by two moms who became increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of the lunchtime trash at their children’s schools. They set out to create sustainably designed food-storage products to reduce the disposable food packaging responsible for so much of the landfill trash.</p>
                <p>The company now offers a complete line of reusable food-storage solutions for lunch, work, travel, picnics, takeout, family leftovers and more. Products include leak-proof stainless steel containers, glass containers and water bottles with protective silicone sleeves, insulated food jars, reusable sandwich wraps and snack bags, bamboo utensils, recycled lunch totes and stainless steel straws.</p>
                <p>U•Konserve products empower people to make a difference every day. One reusable solution can save thousands of single-use plastic bags and containers from landfills. Replacing disposables with long-lasting alternatives is a commitment to foster this important change. In much the same way that a small personal choice can have a big impact, U•Konserve also believes that the impact of a small company can have a powerful and lasting effect on the health of the environment.</p>
