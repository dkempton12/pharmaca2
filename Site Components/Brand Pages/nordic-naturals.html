                <hr class="hr-divider" />
            </div>
            <p>Nordic Naturals was born in Arctic Norway, where founder and CEO Joar Opheim grew up and where fish oil is a part of everyday life.</p>
            <p>When Joar came to California in the mid-1980s to complete his MBA, he was unable to find the quality fish oil he relied on to manage his old gymnastic injuries, and had to consistently bring bottles from Norway—filling his suitcase on trips back and forth.</p>
            <p>Driven by his Norwegian heritage, knowledge of fish oil, and love of science, Joar was inspired to contribute to advancing fish oil quality and industry standards, founding Nordic Naturals in 1995.</p>
            <p>Guided by his personal mission to bring high-quality fish oil to the world, Joar developed several patented fish oil technologies, shaping standards for a country and industry that had few guidelines in place.</p>
            <p>Today, Nordic Naturals is the #1 fish oil in the U.S.† and a leading supplier of fish oils worldwide, offering a wide variety of flavors, concentrations, and delivery forms to meet personalized nutritional needs.</p>
            <h3>Evidence Earns Trust</h3>
            <p>The only objective proof of fish oil quality is third-party analysis. Every batch of fish oil used in Nordic Naturals products is independently tested to verify leading purity and freshness levels. Nordic Naturals offers transparent access to Certificates of Analysis for every product.</p>
            <h3>Better Absorption=Better Results</h3>
            <p>In fish, the omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA naturally occur in triglyceride form. Since its founding, Nordic Naturals has exclusively produced fish oil in the triglyceride form. A 2010 study demonstrated that the bioavailability of concentrated omega-3s in the triglyceride form was 70% more than the ethyl ester form.1 Although more costly, Nordic Naturals is committed to continuing to process their oils in this form, ensuring optimal absorption and results.</p>
            <h3>Taste Matters</h3>
            <p>The award-winning taste of Nordic Naturals products can be traced to uncompromising freshness standards and oxygen-free manufacturing. To support the palatability of their oils even more, a natural flavoring process gives Nordic Naturals liquids and soft gels a light, clean, fruity flavor.</p>
            <h3>Committed to Sustainability</h3>
            <p>Since its founding, Nordic Naturals has been committed to both healthy people and a healthy planet. The company’s environmental stewardship is seen in sustainable sourcing of their fish, environmentally conscious fishing practices, a Marine Stewardship Council Chain of Custody-certified processing plant in Norway, and a LEED Gold-Certified U.S. headquarters.</p>
