                <p>Dr. Tori Hudson N.D. and her business partner Doug Stapf founded Vitanica in 1995 with the dream of providing women with effective and affordable natural health care options.</p>

                <p>At the time the company was started, Dr. Hudson had 10 years of clinical experience to draw on, and realized there was a lack of readily available high quality nutritional/herbal supplements that specifically addressed women’s issues. She wanted to create products not only for her patients in her clinic, but also for health stores, to offer women affordable and reliable natural health care options available on the shelf.  </p>

                <p>Vitanica products serve women in three ways: by addressing topics that affect women directly, such as pregnancy, menstrual cycle care and menopause; addressing health concerns that tend to affect women more than men, such as sleep support, adrenal support, gastrointestinal support, urinary tract support, emotional and calming support; and addressing topics that affect women differently than men, like cardiovascular support. All Vitanica formulas are developed by Dr. Hudson and are based on expertise rooted in her clinical experience, her ongoing scientific research reviews and the time-honored tradition of natural medicine in women's health care.  </p>

                <p>Vitanica products are manufactured with the utmost care and are tested for accuracy, purity and potency. Only the highest quality ingredients go into the products, and loyal supporters, both professionals and consumers, have come to know and rely on the consistent quality Vitanica is known for. The products are made without binders, fillers, preservatives, artificial colors or flavorings. The entire line is 100% suitable for vegetarians, and the majority of the line is also suitable for vegans. </p>
