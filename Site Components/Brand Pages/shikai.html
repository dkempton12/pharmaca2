                <p>For more than 45 years, ShiKai has been using science and nature to create botanical-based, eco-friendly, natural hair and body care products that really work. From batch to bottle, ShiKai formulates and crafts their products by hand in their Northern California facility. Whether it's borage seed oil from Canada, shikakai powder from India or dried flowers from Egypt, ShiKai searches the world for the finest ingredients and blends them with care in order to bring you the best lotions, shower gels, shampoos and conditioners.</p>
                <h3>What Makes ShiKai Different?</h3>
                <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/shikai/about-shikai-1.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-left" alt="Botanicals in lab vials">
                <p><b>SCIENCE</b>: ShiKai was founded by two PhD chemists with extensive knowledge of pharmacological chemistry. All products are formulated based on scientific studies and support.</p>

                <p><b>INNOVATION</b>: ShiKai pioneered non-surfactant lathering agents, borage oil lotions, shower gels, color-enhancing shampoos and neutralized henna shampoos in the natural beauty market.</p>

                <p><b>EXTRACTIONS</b>: ShiKai does their botanical extractions in their own facility with a special process that makes ShiKai products totally unique.</p>

                <p><b>QUALITY & VALUE</b>: ShiKai formulates and produces their products in their own factory, and only the highest quality ingredients are used. Cost savings are passed along to the customer, so you know you are getting the best value on freshly made, premium products that have been crafted with love.</p>

                <p><b>INTEGRITY</b>: ShiKai is straightforward, never promising more than can be delivered, and will never communicate something that isn't true.</p>

                <h3>Safe. Natural. Effective.</h3>
                <p>ShiKai was founded in 1970 by Dr. Dennis T. Sepp, an organic chemist with a strong interest in natural, Ayurvedic ingredients. Dr. Sepp was convinced that the natural world could provide safer, more effective alternatives to commonly used chemicals. His first study was with shikakai (Acacia Concinna), an East Indian herbal used for cleansing the hair. The result was the first ShiKai shampoo and the beginning of a company. Dr. Sepp continues to formulate all ShiKai products and actively manages the business with his children.</p>
