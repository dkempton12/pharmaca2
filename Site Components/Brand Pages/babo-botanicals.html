                <p>Babo is the name of founder Kate Solomon's son's security bunny, who continues to comfort and soothe him while he sleeps. Kate and her family have really come to depend on Babo! &quot;My mission is to provide the highest quality, purest hair, scalp and skin care products for babies and kids. Both my personal and professional experiences have contributed to my inspiration for the line,&quot; says Kate.</p>

                <p>Kate draws from 10 years of experience in product development for beauty companies such as L'Oreal, Givenchy and Avon. After the birth of her first child, it seemed to her that most baby &quot;grooming&quot; products were long on chemical names and didn't truly address children's particular hair and skin problems. Kate sought to develop a line of botanical products that offer parents the same level of choice they value in selecting products for themselves.</p>
                
                <p><i>Fresh solutions based on proven plant science</i> Several years ago Kate started down a path that would ultimately combine her expertise in hair care with her passion for natural ingredients. Kate began working with top botanists to develop a line of products that reflect the attributes she values for her own children &mdash; sulfate free and allergy-tested, containing certified organic ingredients and developed using plant-based science. Kate also worked with hair stylists from top Manhattan salons to ensure product performance and professional quality.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&quot; I just wanted to say thank you for creating such a fabulous product! We are on our second bottle of shampoo now and we love it! We can't stop smelling our just-turned-four-year-old's hair :) &quot; -Sharon</p>

                <p>&nbsp;&quot;Just wanted to give you a great, big THANK YOU! I absolutely love your products! My six year old, Riley uses the Tea Tree shampoo for lice prevention and my two year old has just finished up her Lavendar Meadowsweet shampoo and wash. We love, love, love the detangler too! Just placed my first order to try the Oatmeal line. I've tried tons of organic products in the past and this is the ONLY organic line that I would recommend - the stuff really works!&quot; -Martabel</p>
                
                <p>&quot;The Cucumber Aloe Clean Sport Shampoo works very well for straw-like hair after being in the pool for hours . Our other shampoo left hair feeling brittle, but this one has my girl's hair feeling soft again!&quot; -Leandrea</p>
                
                <p>&quot;I can&rsquo;t tell you how much your Oatmilk Calendula line has helped with my baby&rsquo;s eczema. She has suffered for 2 years and taken steroids and prescriptions and nothing has helped until your products came out. Thank you so much for making such a wonderful line.&quot; -Editor of <i>Shape</i> Magazine</p>
                <p>&quot;I wanted to be sure to write back and say thank you so much for introducing me to your hair detanglers. It works wonders on my little Hadley&rsquo;s hair and she feels like a big girl using it she says, she will be three years old in 2 weeks. I love all the natural ingredients. It&rsquo;s nice to see a more modern all natural formula for children&rsquo;s hair that works!&quot; -Megan</p>
                <p>&quot;These products are great for adults too! I love that I wash my hair with the shampoo and for the first time in probably 26 years I have not needed to use conditioner and really only use the spray for some flyaways or as a refresher as it smells fabulous! I tell anyone and everyone who will listen and hope they will come to you for their products soon, if they haven't already! I've noticed a huge improvement in my husband's hair as well... He is pushing 32 and those sulfate ridden shampoos were increasing his hair loss.&quot; - Carrie and Tim</p>
