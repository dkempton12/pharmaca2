                <p>RADIUS is renowned for its combination of innovative designs, premium materials and eco-conscious manufacturing. RADIUS is redefining ordinary personal care products to enhance the quality and enjoyment of everyday routines.</p>

                <p>The only American Dental Association-recommended natural toothbrush brand, RADIUS brushes feature ergonomic right and left handed brushes to ensure the dentist-recommended 45-degree angle for brushing. RADIUS brushes last 2x to 3x longer than other brushes and have up to 300 percent more bristles than an ordinary toothbrush. By designing toothbrushes with large enough heads to serve as both a tooth and gum brush, RADIUS has created a tool that is a fundamental key to preventive health.</p>

                <p>The idea is pretty simple… If you make a quality product, it will last longer and people won’t need to throw it away. RADIUS products are made to last, which means they are being used longer and not filling up landfills, while still providing you with the excellence you have come to expect. RADIUS is a women-run, family-owned and operated company that manufactures in a solar-powered, 20,000 sq. ft., restored feed mill built in the early 1800s in the picturesque farming town of Kutztown, Penn. Each product is inspected by hand, designed to last and unconditionally guaranteed.</p>

            <h3>Original Toothbrush</h3>
            <p>“When people brush their teeth, two of the biggest mistakes people make are brushing too hard and not long enough, but the RADIUS Original helps combat these two issues with its customized grip and wide head. With its thin, gentle bristles that reach all areas of the mouth easily, the RADIUS Original helps people meet ADA recommendations with their dental habits.”<br />
            <i>—Richard Reddy, D.D.S.</i></p>

            <h3>Source Toothbrush</h3>
            <p>“What is special about the RADIUS Source is that it takes into consideration the earth while still providing a remarkable brush for cleaning teeth. With its slender, oval head and fine, gentle bristles, the Source reaches all surface areas of the mouth and gums — perfect for someone who has a tough time reaching back molars.”<br />
            <i>—Richard Reddy, D.D.S.</i></p>

            <h3>Children's Toothbrushes</h3>
            <p>"These toothbrushes are making it easy for parents to teach their children about the importance of brushing teeth. Many parents are not even aware that babies and young toddlers can also benefit from the use of a toothbrush. Starting at a young age is crucial for a long-lasting, healthy mouth, and we are happy to have RADIUS leading this initiative."<br />
