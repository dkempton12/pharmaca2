            <p>Mayway is a family business that has been importing and distributing traditional Chinese medicine since 1969, when Alan and Meilin Lau came to America and opened a tiny herb shop in San Franciscoâ€™s Chinatown. They were passionate about providing the highest quality herbs and herbal remedies to their fellow immigrants. As destiny would have it, their shop also became a vital resource for pioneering American herbalists and the budding acupuncturist community.</p>

            <p>Through the last four decades, their small business has grown into one of the leading Chinese herbal medicine suppliers in the US, serving more than 25,000 acupuncturists, herbalists and health product retailers across the country. Now helmed by a second generation, Mayway is staffed by a team of passionate people who are proud to provide products that heal and nurture.</p>
