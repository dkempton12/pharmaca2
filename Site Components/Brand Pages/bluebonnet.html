                <p>Bluebonnet is proud to hold true to the original mission it started with in 1991: to offer the cleanest, most wholesome dietary supplements on the market. Bluebonnet has focused all of its resources on the five powers or principles upon which the supplement industry was founded &mdash;Nature, Science, Quality, Truth and Knowledge&mdash;each of which also represents one of the five petals of the Texas state flower from which they take their name.</p>
                
                <p>Bluebonnet is proud to be one of the few vitamin companies that actually manufactures its own natural dietary supplements using the best ingredients the earth has to offer while packaging them in recyclable amber glass bottles to best protect and preserve the nutrients and the environment.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, Bluebonnet is proud to produce its supplements in a 100,000-square-foot, kosher-certified, state of-the-art manufacturing, packaging and distribution facility with unrivaled in-house analytical laboratories to ensure quality control from start to finish.</p>
                
                <p>The company continues to make contributions to nutritional science by launching many industry firsts: the only active antioxidant form of CoQ10 (Ubiquinol), the only orally available, vegetarian form of SOD (GliSODin&reg;), nucleotides, functional natural omega-3 fish oils for brain, joint and heart health, revolutionary condition-specific formulas such as CholesteRice&reg;, as well as cutting-edge sports nutrition products that set new standards for purity.</p>
                
                <p>In addition, environmental stewardship and social responsibility have been part of Bluebonnet&rsquo;s corporate culture since their inception. As citizens of the world, Bluebonnet believes companies and individuals must do their part to help preserve the earth and its limited resources. At Bluebonnet, that includes enterprise-wide &ldquo;green&rdquo; initiatives, recycling programs, use of alternative energy options such as wind and solar, and eco-friendly manufacturing practices. These actions represent a new generation that supports sustainability, reduced dependency on fossil fuels and giving back to the community and the world at large.</p>
                
                <p>Over the past 23 years, Bluebonnet has become a serious advocate for the rights of consumers to have access to alternative health care products. Bluebonnet officers have played a significant role in this by sitting on boards of both regional and national trade associations like the Natural Products Association (NPA), as well as funding lobbying efforts at state and federal levels whenever there is legislation that can potentially threaten our industry.</p>
