                <p>Vital Proteins helps people feel better and live fuller lives through sustainably sourced nutrition products that promote health, fitness and natural beauty. Their supplements provide nourishing collagen and help promote the body’s own production of collagen—an essential nutrient that is often stripped from our diets by modern food processing.</p> 

                <p>We know that while our bodies’ collagen production slows as we age, our need for it only grows. Vital Proteins believes that if you want to, you can make the most out of every moment you’re given—that your body shouldn’t be a limitation, but a catalyst.</p> 

                <p>Vital Proteins products feature essential proteins sourced from pasture-raised cows in Brazil and New Zealand, and wild-caught fish in Hawaii. Why go so many extra miles for these sources? Because there’s nothing more important than one’s health, and Vital Proteins believes the body needs and deserves high-quality building blocks for life’s adventures.</p>

                <p class="center">SUCCESS FOR VITAL PROTEINS MEANS HELPING EACH PERSON LIVE A FULLER, MORE VIBRANT LIFE.</p>
