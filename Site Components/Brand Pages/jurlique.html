                <hr class="hr-divider" />
            </div>
            <p>Jurlique has spent more than 25 years unearthing potent organic ingredients and developing their unique Bio-Intrinsic™ process to create the purest, most powerful skin care possible. From their organic farm in South Australia to their leading natural innovations, they’ve unlocked the potential of combining nature with science to create esthetically pleasing, effective products. For you, that simply means healthy, more beautiful skin.</p>

            <h3>The Jurlique farm</h3>
            <p>Plants on the Jurlique farm live a pampered life. Jurlique’s founders searched the world for the richest, cleanest earth on which to establish the farm, and found it in the Adelaide Hills. Today, this pristine environment is home to a wide variety of plants, herbs and flowers that lend their natural power to Jurlique’s high-performance blends. As the only Australian beauty brand with their own certified organic farm (certified by NASAA, National Association of Sustainable Agriculture, Australia), they can attest to the purity of our harvest.</p>

            <p>They follow strict organic farming principles in order to achieve their accreditation. To preserve the perfection of nature, they tend, pick and sort crops by hand. By working with nature and never against it, they foster richer soil, which means healthier plants, potent extracts and more efficacious products. So it’s a natural progression from better farming to more beautiful skin.</p>

            <h3>What’s the secret?</h3>
            <p>Jurlique doesn’t subscribe to the idea that beautiful skin starts in a laboratory. They believe that no synthetic formula can match the power of nature to promote radiant, healthy-looking skin. That’s why Jurlique developed their proprietary Bio-Intrinsic™ process. This artisanal approach, honed over generations of research and development, draws out the potent elements present in botanicals, isolates them, intensifies them and reformulates them to be even greater than the sum of their parts. By unlocking the full potential of nature, they’ve proven that harsh chemical formulations simply aren’t required. True beauty begins in the earth.</p>

            <h3>Natural skin care with uniquely enhanced power and efficacy</h3>
            <p>Everything Jurlique does is geared toward formulating products that address the causes of skin concerns to enhance radiance and health. This allows Jurlique to deliver noticeable, lasting benefits regardless of your skin composition or how many seasons you’ve seen. Their products complement one another, which means Jurlique can deliver a ritual that’s customized to your skin’s unique needs. Their exacting standards are key to their success…and the real proof is that products pass the most important test – they give you beautiful, healthy skin.</p>

            </div>

            <p><b>Rose Hand Cream</b><br />
            &quot;I have been using this cream for more than 10 years. I used to work with chemicals at one point, tried every hand cream available until this...It saved my hands! I now recommend it to everyone. It has helped friends with problem skin on the hands - including men too - yes it&rsquo;s true!&quot;</p>

            <p><b>Rosewater Balancing Mist</b><br />
            &quot;My skin has become EXTRA sensitive over the last year with eczema flaring up underneath my eyes, etc. However using this, I have found no problems whatsoever! It smells beautiful and fresh, like real garden roses. It does not smell old-fashioned like some other 'rose scents.' I find this leaves my skin hydrated, radiant and dewy. I also use this to help set my makeup and it creates a beautiful finish. I would highly recommend this and would never be without it.&quot;</p>
