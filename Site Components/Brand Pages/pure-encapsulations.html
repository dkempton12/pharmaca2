            <p>A: Yes. Pure Encapsulations manufactures supplements in its own state-of-the-art facility in Sudbury, Mass. All manufacturing takes place in temperature, humidity and dust-controlled rooms. Each piece of equipment is dismantled and sterilized before each production run. This includes scales, mills, blenders, powder fillers, encapsulating machines and capsule counters. Their warehouse is climate controlled in order to maximize the stability of raw materials and finished products. Pure Encapsulations is an FDA-inspected facility and is NSF-GMP registered in the U.S., GMP certified in Canada and exceeds the standards of the United States Pharmacopeia (USP).</p>

            <h3>Q: Where are ingredients sourced from?</h3>
            <p>A: Pure Encapsulations’ ingredients are selected solely on the basis of quality and purity and are provided in their most bioavailable forms. They source premium raw materials from trusted industry leaders, including the finest suppliers from the U.S., France, Japan, Switzerland, Germany and Italy. All ingredients are tested for purity and potency by independent certified laboratories. Ingredient suppliers must meet rigorous testing and quality criteria to qualify as a Pure Encapsulations supplier.</p>

            <h3>Q: Is everything in the capsule listed on the label?</h3>
            <p>A: Pure Encapsulations has a full-label disclosure policy. Supplement labels have always listed all ingredients, including the composition of the raw material. Additionally, standardizations of herbal extracts are provided to indicate primary active marker compounds. Furthermore, minerals are listed by their true elemental weights.</p>

            <h3>Q: Do Pure Encapsulations products contain wheat, rice, gluten, dairy, fillers, etc?</h3>
            <p>A: Products do not contain wheat, gluten, nuts, egg, soy, dairy, preservatives or hydrogenated oils, unless specifically noted on the label. The beta glucan in IsoProtein Plus and PureWeigh PREMEAL Beverage is gluten-free. Furthermore, their products contain no hidden coatings, excipients, binders, fillers, shellacs, artificial colors, artificial flavors or fragrance. They do not use magnesium stearate, preservatives, BHA or BHT. Please note that Pure Encapsulations products are not certified kosher.</p>

            <h3>Q: What does hypo-allergenic mean?</h3>
            <p>A: The term hypo-allergenic is used to describe products that are free of binders, fillers, excipients, dyes and common allergens. All of Pure Encapsulations products are hypo-allergenic.</p>

            <h3>Q: What is the hypo-allergenic plant fiber used to fill capsules for some products?</h3>
            <p>A: The hypo-allergenic plant fiber used is a pharmaceutical-grade alpha cellulose derived from purified specialty grades of wood pulp from Southern Pine. Due to the nature of the raw material (wood pulp) and the manufacturing process, it does not contain alcohol, grain, corn, corn starch, sulfa, sulfites, animal products or gluten. In addition, it is free of pesticides and heavy metals. There are no known allergens in this plant fiber.</p>

            <h3>Q: What is the source of Pure Encapsulations’ vegetable capsules?</h3>
            <p>A: The capsules are made from Southern Pine, grown in the US. The pine is pesticide free.</p>

            <h3>Q: What does it mean that their herbal extracts are standardized?</h3>
            <p>A: A standardized extract is one that guarantees the precise concentration of what is considered the active, or pharmacological, ingredient of the herb. When an herbal extract is not standardized, the amount of the key constituent cannot be determined nor can it be consistent from one capsule to the next. Herbs that are standardized provide consistent, maximum nutritional benefits.</p>
