                <p>Host Defense fuses the skill sets of two experts: Paul Stamets and C. Dusty Yao. Paul's long-time expertise in the taxonomy and cultivation of mushrooms perfectly matched C. Dusty Yao's years of making herbal extracts. The marriage—literally—of these two experts gave rise to the Host Defense products you enjoy today. Their shared passion for exploring the natural world, from thousands of hours of hiking (and laughing) through the old growth forest, and their combined ideas created the wellspring that gave birth to Host Defense.</p>
                <p>Join Host Defense as they continue to walk this path of exploration and healing, blending modern science with ancient traditions and honoring and sharing the wisdom of nature. Host Defense is more than a product line: They are on a myco-mission to spread the power of mushrooms supporting healthy lifestyles.</p>
                <p>Host Defense is also devoted to helping the community. With support from Host Defense, Washington State University investigates ways to help overcome honeybee Colony Collapse Disorder with the help of mushrooms.</p>
