                <p>Boody was born in Sydney, Australia with the goal of designing simple, comfortable and attractive apparel using Earth-friendly materials. Boody’s founders had been searching for comfortable underwear and bodywear that also satisfied their personal pursuit of eco-friendly fabrics and processes. Then they discovered the power of bamboo textiles.</p>
                
                <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/boody/boody-logo-2.jpg" alt="About Boody Eco wear" class="pull-right">
                
                <p>That’s why Boody is sourced from the finest quality yarn spun from bamboo, one of the fastest growing plants on earth. Boody’s bamboo is grown in regenerating forests and requires far less water than traditional cotton. The viscose is blended with a touch of nylon and elastane to create a fabric that’s superbly soft, stretchy and wrinkle-free. Boody is thermo-regulating, breathable and eco-friendly; the perfect fit for you and the planet.</p>
                
                <p>Now headquartered in sunny San Diego, Boody is sold through retail partners like Pharmaca who are committed to social responsibility and selling eco-friendly goods. Boody ensures that every product created is good for both you and the earth. This collection of everyday essentials is stylish, soft, individualistic and, most of all, friendly to the world around us.</p>
