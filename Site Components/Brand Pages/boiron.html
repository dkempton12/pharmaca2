                <h3>Arnicare</h3>
                
                <p>&ldquo;Arnicare works! I don&rsquo;t leave home without it. I carry it in my purse and in my CamelBak. If I bump into a random corner or fall off my bike onto a rock, I have it handy to put it on right away. The swelling goes down quickly. I then apply it three times a day throughout the life of the bruise, which is dramatically decreased in both pain and intensity. Thanks for making such a great product!&rdquo;<br />
                &mdash;Becky G., Austin, Texas</p>
                
                <p>&ldquo;Arnicare Gel is just what I need. The clear gel isn&rsquo;t sticky or greasy. I don&rsquo;t notice any odor, and it absorbs into my skin quickly. The coolness feels nice instantly and within a few moments &ndash; poof! &ndash; my aches and pains are significantly reduced. I&rsquo;ve used it for muscle aches and strains and for bruises. This is my go-to product for fast pain relief. If you experience aches and pains, Arnicare is worth checking out.&rdquo;<br />
                &mdash;Valerie M., Silverado, Calif.</p>
                <hr />
                <h3>Oscillococcinum</h3>
                
                <p>&ldquo;My daughter practiced for MONTHS to be in four performances of the high school play. The day of dress rehearsal, she came down with the flu&mdash;a fever of 102&deg;, chills, body aches, etc. Her dance instructor told her to give Oscillococcinum a try. She took three vials per day for four days. She got through all of the performances with FLYING colors, and the fever and all went away. You would never have known she had anything wrong with her. We swear by it now. I have my family of four taking it anytime they feel something coming on. Love this stuff!&rdquo;<br />
                &mdash;Lori P. Blandburg, Pa.</p>
                
                <p>&ldquo;My wife had the flu that carried on for days, but I was experiencing nothing, considering she was so miserable. Then I sneezed. Instantly, I took Oscillococcinum, which was right before I went to bed. I woke up feeling like I got hit by a train&ndash;high fever, soreness and fatigue. I was determined Oscillococcinum would work for me, so I took the recommended doses that day. The next day, I felt so good, nobody would ever have guessed I was so miserable the day before. I was so glad it didn&rsquo;t drag on for days. Thanks Oscillococcinum!&rdquo;<br />

                <h3>Calendula</h3>
                
                <p>&quot;I want to sing the praises of your Calendula Ointment! We use it ALL the time in this house. It is a first aid must-have in our opinion. Funny enough, it was recommended to me by my midwife to pick some up for our homebirth. Thank you so much for such a dependable product.&quot;<br />
                &mdash;Danielle C., Tucson, Ariz.</p>
                
                <p>&quot;About two weeks before the Ironman 70.3 in Austin, Texas, I fell off my bike and scraped the side of my leg. I used Calendula Ointment for the first time, and now I will never go back to commercial ointments. Calendula was soothing and refreshing on contact, and within the first 24 hours, I could tell the ointment was speeding up the healing process. In the same week, I went for an open water swim in my wetsuit, and the strap that holds the zipper up kept rubbing the back of my neck every time I turned my head to breathe. Afterwards, I had a mild burn from the friction. Once again, Calendula came to the rescue!&quot;<br />
                &mdash;Jeremy Koontz, Elite Triathlete &amp; Ultramarathoner</p>
                
                <hr />
                <h3>Camilia</h3>
                
                <p>&ldquo;My son, Zachary, started teething at only 3 months old. Too scared to give him medications, I thought we were just out of luck. He went from sleeping through the night to waking up screaming his head off every hour. But after finding Camilia, I got my happy boy back. I cannot recommend this product enough! Thank you for such an amazing, safe product.&rdquo;<br />
                &mdash;Ashley C., Salem, Ore.</p>
                
                <p>&ldquo;My baby started teething at 2 1/2 months of age, really early, so I started giving him Camilia. After a few doses, he started opening his mouth wide when he saw the little vial in my hand. He must have felt better right away. I am so glad I have found this product; it beats anything else out there.&rdquo;<br />
                &mdash;Lily L., Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
