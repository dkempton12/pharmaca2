                <p>Every morning on family farms, like the Myers farm in Cashton, Wisc., dairy farmers start their work hours before the sun comes up. Steve and Jessica Myers bring the cows in from the pasture, milk them in their barn and then release them back into the fields where they can graze to their hearts’ content. These cows are free of artificial bovine growth hormones, pasture raised and grass-fed.</p>

                <p>Around 8am, after the morning work has been done and usually during breakfast with their kids, a truck pulls up to take their fresh milk to the Westby cheese maker. Once there, the cheese making process begins. For more than 110 years, master cheese makers at Westby have turned fresh milk into artisan cheese.</p>

                <p>Whey is a byproduct of the cheese-making process and offers one of the purest forms of complete protein. This fresh liquid whey is transported just about 60 miles to the tera’swhey green manufacturing facility in Reedsburg, Wisc. Here, the water is removed from the whey through ultra-filtration and then dried at low temperatures to form protein powder. This whey is certified organic, grass fed, rBGH/rBST free, non GMO, gluten free certified, soy free and kosher.</p>

                <p>The protein powder is then carefully prepared for blending and packaging, a process done by real people, not robots. The powder is then blended with premium ingredients like authentic Madagascar Organic Bourbon Vanilla and Fair Trade Dark Chocolate Cocoa, chosen for their delicious taste and nutritional benefits.</p>

                <p>When you buy tera’swhey, you take home pure nutrition and simple ingredients, along with a commitment to ethical sources and earth friendly practices. And that’s the tera’s story.</p>
