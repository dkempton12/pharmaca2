                <p>Love and respect for nature have characterized Weleda’s business activity since 1921, when Dr. Rudolf Steiner, a philosopher and scientist in Switzerland, founded the company to make products from natural ingredients. Steiner believed that plants and people have a symbolic relationship and we can use nature to heal. From his ideas grew Biodynamic® farming principles, Waldorf education and plant-based medicines.</p>
                <p>Weleda is committed to the environmentally friendly sourcing of raw materials, fair trade, Biodynamic® cultivation, and the high quality and purity of their skin and body care products—all while actively promoting sustainability around the world and within the company. Every Weleda product embodies their unique knowledge, quality and values that have earned Weleda the trust of consumers around the world.</p>
                <h3>Weleda’s Farming Principles:</h3>
                <p><strong>Organic: Do No Harm</strong></p>
                <p>Relies on techniques such as crop rotation, green manure, compost and biological pest control. Organic farming allows the use of some fertilizers and pesticides if they are of natural origin. Weleda’s Rosa damascena flowers are grown organically in the Isparta region of Turkey.</p>
                <p><strong>Wild-crafted: The Natural Way</strong></p>
                <p>Plants are cultivated without chemicals in their native environments, and harvested in a sustainable way in order to conserve resources. For example, The arnica they source is wild-crafted in the Apuseni Mountains in Romania.</p>
                <p><strong>Biodynamic®: Beyond Organic</strong></p>
                <p>An ecological, ethical and spiritual approach to agriculture that goes beyond organic to actually heal the soil and create an interconnected, self-sustaining farm. Farmers use sun, moon and planets to guide their planting and harvesting cycles. The calendula in Weleda baby care products is grown biodynamically in their own plant gardens in Germany.</p>

                <p>Weleda’s Quality Standards:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No parabens or phthalates</li>

            </div>
            <p>Weleda grows dozens of acres of herbs, flowers and fruits, but it’s not everything they need to cultivate beauty in the world. So Weleda has developed partnerships that allow them to source ingredients from both small and large farms, cooperatives and cultivation projects, all while committing to sustainable, Fair Trade practices. Below are some of the key ingredients and more information about their Fair Trade partnerships:</p>
