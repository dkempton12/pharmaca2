                <p>Almost everyone experiences dry skin. The key to treating it starts with a basic understanding of skin and skin cell composition.</p>

                <p>At Trilipid Research Institute, they understand the structure of skin. Their 40+ years of experience researching and testing ingredients has equipped them with valuable knowledge to create products for the treatment of skin.</p>

                <p>Trilipiderm’s philosophy is simple: Create products focused on solving and preventing dry skin using only ingredients that mimic what’s found naturally in our skin.</p>

                <p>Born in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where nature is at once its most amazing and most harsh, Trilipiderm’s line of dry skin moisturizers are tough enough to hold up in any condition and gentle enough to pamper skin.</p>

                <p>Trilipididerm’s products:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use active natural ingredients to moisturize, eliminate dryness and help prevent the return of dryness</li>
                    <li>Help form a natural boundary to seal in moisture and reduce Trans Epidermal Water Loss (TEWL)</li>
                    <li>Help replace essential lipids in the skin that have been lost due to use of strong soaps and detergents, or over-exposure to the sun</li>
                    <li>Improve the tone, texture, elasticity and appearance of the skin</li>
                    <li>Leave skin smooth and soft, with no rough, flaky surface</li>
                    <li>Relieve irritation</li>

            <p>I started using this lotion last summer in Arizona. I could not find any cream that hydrated and did not feel heavy or greasy. Great product!<br />
            <i>— Jay R. Scottsdale, AZ</i></p>

            <p>The trilipiderm® All-Body Moisture Retention Crème is the best lotion I have tried. I am a product addict and always have many lotions open at once. From now on I will only have Trilipiderm® on the bathroom counter!<br />
            <i>— Jennifer C. Sarasota, FL</i></p>

            <p>This stuff is a revelation. Because I’m forever washing TV make-up off, I need a good moisturizer. Trilipiderm® is a godsend. It hydrates completely, doesn’t sting like some other products, and lasts. It’s the one product on the bathroom counter, which my wife and I share. She loves it as much as I do. Thank you, Trilipiderm®!<br />
