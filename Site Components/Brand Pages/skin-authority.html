                <p>Skin Authority’s passion for optimal skin health and beauty is authentically derived from hands-on procedure experiences with their own patients in medical skin clinics in Southern California, partnerships with nationally recognized surgeons, oncologists and immunologists, and work designing skin care programs for top wellness destinations.</p>

                <p>Skin Authority’s ethnically diverse customer base became the “designers” of the brand’s product innovations. They expressed their expectations for immediate cosmetic results, a desire to improve the overall health of their skin and the need for clean skin care made without fragrances, dyes, parabens or animal testing. As a result, Skin Authority’s SGF 4 Technology™, VitaD Fortified™ formulas, and superfood Beauty Infusion™ innovations were born to deliver skin transformation in a way never before seen.</p>

                <p>Paired with powerful product performance, Skin Authority puts the guidance of a live, certified Skin Coach at your fingertips to personalize your routine to your unique needs and lifestyle. Skin Coaches are there to answer questions, offer support and encourage you to stick with it long enough to achieve the results you want to see. Most importantly, they can help you adapt your routine as your skin or lifestyle changes.</p>

               <h3>What is Clean Skin Care?</h3>
               <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/skin-authority/about-clean-skin.jpg" class="img-responsive pull-right" alt="">
               <ul>
                    <li>No parabens</li>
                    <li>No added dyes</li>
                    <li>No added perfumes</li>
                    <li>No microbeads</li>
                    <li>No animal testing</li>
               </ul>
               <h3>Sustainable Practices</h3>
               <p>Renewable Energy - Skin Authority works internally and with supplier partners to offset their carbon footprint by purchasing wind and other renewable energy credits.</p>

                <p>Sustainable Packaging - From the very beginning, Skin Authority has taken a sustainable approach to packaging—using recycled paper, plastics and glass, printing with soy ink, and eliminating most outer cartons or secondary packaging. If it doesn’t need a box, they don’t use a box.</p>
