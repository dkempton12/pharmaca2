            <h3>Family Owned &amp; Operated</h3>
            <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/flora/about-flora-1.jpg" alt="Thomas with his Grandfather Otto founder of Salus Haus" class="pull-right">
            <p>Flora is owned and operated by Thomas Greither, a third-generation health entrepreneur who follows in the footsteps of his father and grandfather. His grandfather, Mr. Otto Greither, was founder of the world-famous Salus-Haus in Germany in 1916; his father, Mr. Otto Greither, Jr., dedicated his life to the discovery, production and distribution of natural health care products. Flora has preserved this dedication by perfecting herbal remedies that deliver maximum purity, quality and potency.</p>

            <h3>Standards &amp; Certifications</h3>
            <p>All of Flora's products are manufactured in accordance with GMP standards; Flora’s facilities and manufacturing procedures are in compliance with all regulatory agencies in Canada and the United States, including Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, Flora is a certified organic producer and processor overseen by the third-party certifying agency Quality Assurance International, (QAI). This means that Flora’s organic herbal remedies are guaranteed top quality and chemical free, from the seed that is planted to the harvest, and from the post-harvest facilities to final production and packing. Flora also partnered with the Non-GMO Project in 2012 as part of its ongoing commitment to providing the highest quality supplements available.</p>

            <h3>Environmental Responsibility</h3>
            <p>Flora’s dedication to preserving the environment consists of three key initiatives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The use of the most ecologically friendly packaging for products</li>
                <li>Working with local farmers to obtain ecologically sustainable supplies of high quality, botanical raw materials</li>
                <li>Eco-friendly production policies and procedures</li>
            </ul>
