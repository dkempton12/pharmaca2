                <h3>The Vapour Story</h3>
                <p>Art and alchemy collide in the enchanted mountains of Taos, NM, where Founders Krysia Boinis and Kristine Keheley create Vapour. A muse for infinite creativity, Taos has a light and an energy all its own that is reflected in Vapour’s unique formulas.</p>
                <p>Krysia’s knowledge of healing botanicals and alchemical blending create products greater than the sum of their parts. Vapour’s Herbal Enlightenment Complex is the pinnacle of this intention. Containing plant essences with cultural and spiritual meaning as well as supreme skin-nourishing benefits, the Complex infuses Vapour’s core products.</p>
                <p>To Kristine, color is a language and has a life force. Her masterful blending of natural mineral pigments creates Vapour’s palette of modern, classic Fine Art Infused Color. From foundation to lipstick, Vapour’s shades play beautifully across all skin tones, from the lightest light to the darkest dark.</p>
                <p>Vapour truly blurs the line between skin care and makeup, suspending gorgeous color blends in concentrated, moisturizing bases that are bursting with antioxidant activity.</p>
                <p>Vapour’s bold approach to crafting high-performance cosmetics includes only the purest, active ingredients from the earth—and nothing else. With the highest purity standards and an unwavering commitment to both sustainability and luxury, Vapour has reinvented organic beauty.</p>

                <h3>Aer Next-Level Deodorant</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>"This is a fan letter from an extreme fan. Your Deodorant is exceptional!!!!!!!! I’ve never used anything that worked so well and didn’t give me a rash. I want it in every scent, and I want to start giving it as gifts to everyone I know."<br />
                <i>-Katey</i></p>

                <p>"Vapour’s AER deodorant leaves me feeling dry and comfortable. Great if you’re used to a traditional antiperspirant. This holds up under even the hottest, toughest classes. Yep, life altering."<br />
                <i>-Lisa</i></p>

                <h3>Aura Multi Use</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>"This product just makes me happy. All of your products do, to be honest. I can see the difference in the condition in my skin. You can feel the nourishment doing its work as you apply the color. This is the perfect shade for daytime. Gives a nice pop of color without being too intense. I really love it on my lips, too. This is a home run for sure!"<br />
                <i>-Lisa</i></p>

                <p>"Love this blush! Great pigmentation, great finish, travel friendly, lasts for hours. I also love that this is multi-use so you could use it for blush, lipstick, even blend some into your crease on your eye to give some soft definition. Just pop some mascara on after that and you can look so refreshed and all with using just one product for almost your whole look! Vapour Beauty can do no wrong!"<br />
                <i>-Laura</i></p>

                <h3>Atosmosphere Foundation Luminous + Soft Focus Formulas</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>"I can honestly say, I have found my “holy grail” foundation. I will never go back! This foundation lasts for a really long time. One pump is all it takes. Your skin actually improves as you wear it. I cannot say enough good things about this product. I look forward to a long-term love affair with this company!"<br />
                <i>-Julie</i></p>

                <p>"From the moment I looked at my face after I got done putting my samples on, I felt like my skin was thanking me. I haven’t seen my skin look so fresh and radiant in years. This is, hands down, the best foundation I’ve ever put on my skin. I feel like I gained at least 5 years back, and at 46, I’ll take it! Can’t wait to buy EVERYTHING!!"<br />
                <i>-Lisa</i></p>

                <h3>Stratus Skin Perfecting Primer Luminous + Soft Focus Formulas</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>"I love this primer! I have the stick formula for dry skin and it works amazing with the Vapour stratus foundation (stick formula). My skin feels healthy, I have no breakouts, and the primer helps my foundation stay on all day. I couldn’t be happier. I’ve waited a week to write this review because I wanted seven days to see how my skin reacted and whether I would like the all day wear. I love it!!! It’s natural, not heavy but looks great on."<br />
                <i>-Jacqueline</i></p>
                <p>"I have tried a ton of primers but this one is by far my favorite. It leaves my skin soft and smooth. The texture is thick but spreads so easily and smoothly. I am able to use this alone or with the Atmosphere Soft Focus Foundation and I am happy with both results. I would recommend this product to anyone wanting to achieve a clean soft complexion."<br />
                <i>-Kristina</i></p>

                <h3>Siren Lipstick</h3>
                <hr />
                <p>"I was honestly blown away by the quality of these lipsticks. I’ve tried several natural lipsticks before and none of them can even come close to the Siren lipsticks. I have several nude shades and they are all nicely pigmented, incredibly comfortable on the lips and they last a decent amount of time on the lips, considering they’re not a matte finish. My favorite shade is Chere, it’s a beautiful dusty rose shade. Love these lipsticks and would definitely recommend them to anyone who is on the look for a natural lippie product!"<br />
                <i>-Teodora</i></p>
                <p>"This lipstick is a fave and I love that I’m not putting unknown toxins on my lips. The color is rich and luscious and just the right level of opacity and sheen. I’ve been using Au Pair and can’t wait to try other colors."<br />
