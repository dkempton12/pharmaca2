            <img class="pull-right" alt="Herb Pharm owners Ed Smith and Sara Katz" src="/media/wysiwyg/tab_content/herb-pharm/brand-page-herb-pharm-about-ed-and-sara.jpg" />
            <p>Herb Pharm was established in March of 1979 in a pristine mountain valley in Williams, Ore. From the beginning, their mission has been unwavering:</p>

            <p><i>&ldquo;We are committed to providing the highest quality herbal products possible, educating people on the safe and effective use of medicinal herbs and inspiring a love for plants and respect for nature.&rdquo;</i></p>

            <p>Back in the early days, Herb Pharm&rsquo;s &quot;lab&quot; was the home of Ed Smith and Sara Katz, the company's founders and owners. They wanted to establish themselves as the alternative to the rather poor-quality and limited array of medicinal herb products available. Ed and Sara spoke constantly and emphatically of the importance of using organic, high-quality herbs as opposed to the over-dried plant fiber that the few existing companies were using in their products.</p>

            <h3>Today at Herb Pharm</h3>
            <hr />
            <img class="pull-left" alt="Herb Pharm tour" src="/media/wysiwyg/tab_content/herb-pharm/brand-page-herb-pharm-about-group.jpg" />
            <p>Ed and Sara still own and are involved in the daily operations of Herb Pharm, which employs more than 85 people. These operations now include a certified organic herb farm (called the &quot;Pharm Farm&quot;).</p>

            <p>Herb Pharm&rsquo;s certified organic farm is only two miles from their modern manufacturing facility, enabling control over every aspect of production, from the soil and seed, to the herb extraction, to the finished product shipped to customers. Herb Pharm hand-harvests herbs at their peak potency, and within minutes delivers them, fresh and succulent, to the manufacturing facility for prompt extraction. When it comes to herbs they can't grow themselves, they purchase directly from other certified organic herb farms whose owners they personally know and trust.</p>

            <h3>Attention to Detail</h3>
            <hr />
            <img class="pull-right" alt="Herb Pharm In the Lab" src="/media/wysiwyg/tab_content/herb-pharm/brand-page-herb-pharm-about-science.jpg" />
            <p>Ed and Sara are as picky as ever about the plants they use, as well as their meticulous extraction. Herb Pharm extracts each herb according to its own unique physical and biochemical characteristics at an FDA-inspected, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. Herb Pharm is continually looking for ways to improve the quality of their herbal medicines.</p>

            <p>Herb Pharm&rsquo;s broad-spectrum extracts seek to mirror the flavor, aroma and natural plant chemistry found in nature. This stands in stark contrast to the ever-increasing trend toward isolating plant constituents, thus modifying their natural array and balance. Herb Pharm is committed to creating herbal extracts that represent the whole plant, and to the fundamental principles of traditional herbal medicine.</p>
