                <p>Similasan is dedicated to helping families feel good about feeling better. Their gentle remedies help provide natural temporary symptomatic relief from ailments of the eyes, ears, nose, head, and chest.</p>
                <p>Originating in Jonen, Switzerland in 1987, the Similasan brand became popular across Europe. Today, Similasan natural remedies are widely used and well-respected in North America. Their success is due to a commitment to provide relief of symptoms the natural way—by engaging the body's natural defenses to support the immune system. To combat common ailments of the eye, ear, nose, throat, head, and chest, all of Similasan natural remedies contain high quality ingredients that help temporarily relieve symptoms. Similasan is a family doctor-recommended brand*.</p>

                <h3>What is Homeopathy?</h3>
                <p>Homeopathy is an independent process that works in harmony with the body’s immune system. Homeopathy works from the inside out, helping the body to defend against conditions and provide temporary relief. In contrast to traditional medicine, homeopathy supports the body’s natural defenses instead of suppressing the symptoms. The homeopathic mode of action is similar in theory to an allergy or flu shot.</p>
                <p>In the production of Similasan homeopathic remedies, their natural active ingredients (originating from minerals, plants, or animals) undergo a process of serial dilution, where a microdilution is created. The concentration of that microdilution is represented by an "X". For example, an ingredient diluted to the level of 6X contains 0.0000001% of the active ingredient, thus, the active ingredients in their homeopathic remedies are very diluted and gentle enough for children as young as 2.</p>
                <p>Every Similasan product is formulated using traditional homeopathic guidelines and manufactured in accordance with the FDA's Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), so you can feel good about providing comfort for your family with Similasan natural remedies.</p>
                <p><i>*Based on a 2013 Similasan quantitative study of 202 primary care physicians and physicians who were open to homeopathic treatments (82% selection rate).</i></p>
