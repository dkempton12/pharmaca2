            <p>For more than 20 years, Genuine Health has been an industry leader, renowned for its award-winning natural products that extend across all health categories. </p>

            <h3>Revolutionize Your Gut Health</h3>
            <p>Genuine Health is the first to bring the power of fermentation to your everyday diet with highly absorbable, proven formulas that strengthen gut health and provide next-level nourishment.</p>
            <p>Having long understood the potential of fermented foods and supplements, Genuine Health has spent the last 10 years perfecting the process for creating superior, high-performance fermented products. Breaking new ground for natural health supplements with fermentation exemplifies what Genuine Health stands for: taking quality, high-performance, naturally sourced ingredients and making them even better to help people take their health to the next level.</p>

            <h3>“B”-ing the change we want to see in the world</h3>
            <p>Genuine Health is the first natural supplement company to become a member of the B Corp community. B Corps are a new type of company that uses the power of business to solve social and environmental problems. Genuine Health has a public commitment to maintain the highest standards, transparency in operations, actions and impacts, and inspire others to do the same. Their vision is simple yet ambitious: people using business as a force for good.</p>

            <h3>USE ONLY PURE, NATURAL INGREDIENTS</h3>
            <p>What does natural mean? It means that Genuine Health looks to the healing power of nature for all of their ingredients—avoiding synthetics and GMOs. Genuine Health formulas do not contain any artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners or preservatives, and utilize local and organic ingredients whenever possible. The criteria for every ingredient in each of their formulas is simple and constant: it must be pure, research-proven, safe and effective.</p>

            <h3>RESEACH DRIVEN AND PROVEN</h3>
            <p>All Genuine Health formulas are backed by leading research and contain only clinically proven dosages, based on reputable published studies. They accomplish this with the help of a panel of esteemed health experts, including nutritional researchers and doctors of natural and traditional medicine. Genuine Health also works with renowned scientists and professionals at leading institutions to test many products with published results available.</p>

            <h3>HEALTH PEOPLE, HEALTHY PLANET</h3>
            <p>Genuine Health is so passionate about healthy living that they want people to feel like them, every day! Giving your body the best nourishment is a big part of it, but so is giving back. Genuine Health works with charitable organizations and other great causes through their Genuine Giving initiatives.</p>
            <p>Making a difference in people’s lives extends to caring for the planet, and reducing their environmental footprint is a top priority, which is why Genuine Health’s products contain only the purest ingredients from the most sustainable, Earth-friendly sources. Not only that, but they rely on a green energy provider for office operations, and developed Genuine Planet as a committed initiative to challenge them and their partners to work toward a healthier, cleaner planet, locally and globally. </p>

            <h3>QUALITY</h3>
            <p>Genuine Health does not settle for anything less than producing products of the highest quality, working diligently with suppliers to ensure that their ingredients are the best of the best. They test each and every one, every step of the way from raw to finished product. Not only does Genuine Health meet Health Canada’s exceptionally high standards, they go beyond with testing for anything that may compromise their quality, or the health of consumers. This includes pesticides, heavy metals and any potential contaminants, ultimately bringing consumers the cleanest, most rigorously tested products on the market, with superior, proven ingredients. </p>
