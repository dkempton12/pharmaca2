            <p>New Chapter was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick. New Chapter first sprang from Paul and Barbi's deep commitment to promote health through innovative formulations made with whole herbs and foods. Mother Nature is a powerful force, and New Chapter's humble mission is to Deliver the Wisdom of Nature to all people interested in natural wellness.</p>
            <h3>The Whole-Food Difference</h3>
            <p>New Chapter believes the most appropriate way to deliver nutrients is through the infinite complexity of whole food. To deliver the full profile of nature's bounty to you, they culture vitamins, minerals and herbs in a matrix of organic fruits and vegetables and live probiotics.</p>
            <p>The nutrients are transformed into whole-food complexes for your body's greatest benefit. In fact, New Chapter takes a whole-food approach to every formulation, whether it's whole-food complexed multivitamins, whole fish oil, whole-food plant-based calcium or whole herbs and herbal extracts.</p>
            <h3>Guided by Nature, Validated by Science</h3>
            <p>While they always look first to nature to guide product formulations, New Chapter relies just as heavily on modern science to direct their selection and use of ingredients. Wide-ranging research in the field helps New Chapter's scientific team seek out even greater discoveries in supporting optimal nourishment and health.</p>
            <p>For example, New Chapter's herbals are delivered using innovative supercritical CO2 extraction, a gentle process that helps create a broad-spectrum yet powerfully concentrated herbal extract without the use of high heat.</p>
            <p>Discover the New Chapter difference—nourishment and health sourced from the earth's most beneficial nutrients. Just as nature intended.</p>
