            </div>
            <p>Quality is the top priority at Nature&rsquo;s Way, which has Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certifications from two leading agencies, and an organically certified, certified kosher and Parve manufacturing facility. Nature&rsquo;s Way is a pioneer of science-based supplement development with a pharmaceutical-minded commitment to quality.</p>
            <p><i>Their commitment</i><br />
            Nature&rsquo;s Way believes in unrelenting laboratory testing and support of patented and well-researched products. They stay on the cutting edge by participating in industry methods development, and publishing their research in scientific, peer-reviewed journals.</p>
            <p>The results are a family of products whose efficacy is based on either scientifically valid secondary research, or their own primary research. Such efforts clearly outshine what is typical in an industry where little is required but so much is expected. Nature&rsquo;s Way has done the homework so you can use their products with absolute confidence.</p>
            <p><i>Company history</i><br />
            Nature&rsquo;s Way originated from a circumstance we can all understand&mdash;a family's desperate need to overcome a personal health crisis. Back in the late 1960s, Tom Murdock, the founder of what is now Nature's Way, needed a solution to help his gravely ill wife. After trying conventional medicine without success, Tom and his wife turned to the traditional Native American knowledge of &ldquo;medicinal plants&rdquo; growing in the Arizona desert. As a result, she recovered and lived an additional 25 years.</p>
            <p>Tom Murdock&rsquo;s pioneering spirit did more than save a life&mdash;it led to the renaissance of herbal medicine in America. As word spread about his wife&rsquo;s recovery, Tom set out to find other healthy treasures growing in the Arizona desert. By 1969, Tom and his family had eight new herbal remedies to share with others and thus began the legacy of Nature&rsquo;s Way.</p>
