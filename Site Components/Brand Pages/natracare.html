            <p>Natracare is a specialist and pioneer in organic and natural personal care solutions. Established in 1989, Natracare was created as a direct response to concerns about the serious environmental and health issues surrounding conventional feminine hygiene manufacturing.</p>
            <p>Natracare is the world’s leading manufacturer of organic and natural feminine hygiene products including tampons, pads, panty liners and wipes as well as care for new mothers. The range offers women reliable and comfortable monthly protection, free from plastics, dioxins, perfumes and pesticides, and works just like conventional products.</p>
            <p>In addition, all of Natracare’s feminine hygiene and baby care products are made with only organic and natural materials that meet the highest organic, environmental and biodegradable standards, sourced from raw material producers that manage and monitor resources respectfully and share their principles.</p>
            <p>The Natracare brand philosophy has always been to provide products that never compromise health or the environment. Many brands of sanitary protection contain crude oil plastics, synthetics, harsh chemicals and even dioxin residues, which can cause intimate irritation for women, and 1000s of years of pollution for our environment. All Natracare tampons, pads, liners and wipes are Totally Chlorine Free (TCF) and free of plastic and crude oil derivatives.</p>
            <p>Natracare holds a Green accreditation officiated by the Nordic Ecolabel organization, and is the first feminine hygiene brand to have obtained an International Environmental Product Declaration (a scientifically validated, independently assessed life-cycle analysis that determines the carbon footprint of the products).</p>
            <p>Susie Hewson, founder and developer of Natracare, was awarded the 2008 Women in Ethical Business award. The entire Natracare line has been awarded the LOHAS award for its environmental and sustainable criteria and has the highest ethical Accreditation Index Score, a fully independent endorsement that outlines the ‘premier league’ of genuine corporate social responsibility and ethical companies.</p>

            <p>I think your products are amazing…they are an absolute godsend for me because the chemicals in the conventional products I always used to use eventually started to give me chemical burns every month which took another week to heal from. What a joy not to suffer that any longer. I have been using your products for years now, and when I became a mother I used your new mother pads which are by far the softest and comfiest pads out there that I have found. Add to that the eco-friendliness of your products and you can’t really ask for more. Keep on keeping on, you rock!!</p>

            <p>Just wanted to let you know what marvellous products you’re making! I really appreciate the fact there is somewhere where I can buy such brilliant sanitary protection. It is highly important to me to use protection that has no harmful chemicals and feels comfortable. I have been using your products for a number of years now including wipes and tampons and would never use any brand but yours. So keep up the wonderful work!</p>

            <p>Honestly the best cotton pads, panty liners or tampons I’ve ever used, and so much better for my body, too.</p>

            <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you Natracare. You are my new best friend. I just broke up with o.b. and the J&amp;J group. I am so glad to know about your products! You have a new loyal fan, who is very happy about the fact you provide a product that is 100% cotton, works like a charm, is applicator free, and does not add to the plastic in our landfills.</p>

            <p>I can’t tell you how happy I am with the Natracare products. I have had a terrible allergy with intense itching to sanitary pads including the adhesive strips, so bad my GP said she had never seen such a huge reaction. It would take days for the allergy to disappear despite using a strong steroid cream. I had tried every product out there and had the same reaction. I am totally over the moon as I have now tried Natracare products and have had no reaction. These products have totally transformed my life. Highly recommend them.</p>
