            <p>Inspired by the simple utility, Earth-friendliness and comfort of cloth diapers, GladRags was founded in 1992 in Portland, Ore. It began as a home-based business that quickly outgrew its space and moved to its own building.</p>

            <p>Today, GladRags is still a small company but with a big presence, promoting positive attitudes toward menstruation and making the environment a safer, cleaner place.</p>
            <i>Their mission</i>

            <p>"Reusable pads. That's gross!" But envision your lifetime supply of used pads and tampons in landfills or washed up on a beach. Now that is gross! The menstrual cycle is a healthy and natural process and it is our mission to create healthy products with a positive spin.</p>

            <p>Language is a powerful force. By talking about our cycles more openly&mdash;with positive images and language&mdash;GladRags believes women can re-define menstruation.</p>

            <p><strong>What is a menstrual cup?</strong><br />
            The Keeper Cup, The Moon Cup, Lunette, and The DivaCup are reusable internal devices that catch menstrual blood, rather than absorbing it, as a tampon does.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Why use a menstrual cup?</strong><br />
            A menstrual cup is one of the most convenient, economical, and environmentally friendly forms of menstrual protection around! Here are a few reasons to use them:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You&rsquo;ll never run out of protection&mdash;menstrual cups are reusable on the spot.</li>
                <li>Cups are great for active sports like bike riding, dancing, swimming, yoga, running, hiking, etc.</li>
                <li>When traveling, you won't have to worry about packing lots of products, or risk not being able to find what you need in foreign countries.</li>
                <li>They are perfect for backpacking when every inch of space in your pack counts. It's also the ultimate way to &quot;pack it in, pack it out&quot;!</li>
                <li>No need to carry products around with you all day&mdash;just rinse and re-insert.</li>
                <li>You'll have no surprises if your period comes early&mdash;just keep a menstrual cup in your bag and you'll always be ready.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>How do I insert The Keeper Cup, The Moon Cup, Lunette or The DivaCup?</strong><br />
            First, fold the cup by pressing the sides together. Now fold it in half again. Hold the folded cup between your thumb and index finger. While sitting on the toilet or in an equally relaxed position, simply insert the folded cup completely into the vagina. (If necessary, lightly moisten the rim with water or water-based lubricant&mdash;NOT petroleum jelly). Release your fingers from the cup so it unfolds inside. That's all there is to it!</p>
            
            <p><strong>How do I remove the menstrual cup?</strong><br />
            While sitting on the toilet, grasp the pull-tab firmly so the tips of your fingers pinch the base of the cup. This action will allow air to enter around the cup, releasing the suction and helping with removal. Ease the cup gently forward and downward, supporting the bottom of the cup with your fingertips to prevent spilling. Empty and rinse, then simply reinsert. It's easy with a little practice.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How often should I empty the menstrual cup?</strong><br />
            The Keeper Cup, The Moon Cup, The DivaCup, and Lunette Model 2 hold one full ounce. Lunette Model 1 holds just under an ounce. Since most women flow 2 to 4 ounces during their menstrual period, emptying the cup a few times a day is usually adequate. When your flow is heavy, empty the cup frequently to avoid leaking&mdash;every 2-4 hours. After a month or two, you'll become familiar with your own menstrual flow pattern. And don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;it&rsquo;s safe to wear menstrual cups at night.</p>
