                    <p>Acure&rsquo;s products are free of parabens, sulfates, phthalates, synthetic fragrances, petrochemicals, and animal by-products. Instead, Acure utilizes the most potent, cutting-edge ingredients available to achieve visible results&mdash;because it&rsquo;s not enough to use natural and organic ingredients if the customer isn&rsquo;t realizing tangible results.</p>

                    <p>Acure travels the globe to find the highest quality ingredients to formulate their products, and each ingredient is selected with great care to ensure a sustainable and eco-friendly supply chain.</p>

                    <p>Here are a few of Acure&rsquo;s unique ingredients and strategies.</p>

                    <p><strong>CHLORELLA GROWTH FACTOR (CGF)</strong></p>

                    <p>Chlorella is a single-cell green algae, and is rich in RNA and DNA, the nucleic acids that create life. Our bodies&rsquo; creation of RNA and DNA significantly declines in our early twenties, which leads to aging. Healthy cells count on the perfect replication of our RNA and DNA, and CGF helps boost this process and protect our DNA and RNA during the replication process. Acure&rsquo;s CGF contains 10,000 mg per 100 g of RNA, the highest source available for your skin.</p>

                    <p>CGF is also clinically proven to protect collagen and elastin fibers from the enzymes that destroy them. In fact, clinical studies have shown CGF to increase collagen expression by 333% when used at 1% concentration. Acure&rsquo;s anti-aging products include CGF at an amazing 5% concentration.</p>

                    <p><strong>CUROXIDANT BLEND</strong></p>

                    <p>The curoxidant blend is a combination of five certified organic superfruits and herbs that are freeze-dried and carefully blended to ensure maximum potency. Acure&rsquo;s Curoxidant Blend effectively neutralizes free radicals and helps reverse the signs of aging. You can find Curoxidant in all of Acure&rsquo;s products.</p>

                    <p><i>Certified Organic Acai</i><br />
                    Widely used by people in Central and South America for traditional medicinal purposes due to its ability to fight infection. Acai is now recognized worldwide for its potent antioxidant properties. It&rsquo;s also high in omega fatty acids and anthocyanins.</p>

                    <p><i>Certified Organic Pomegranate</i><br />
                    Popular for its high antioxidant content, pomegranate is now being noticed for its strong anti-inflammatory properties. A University of Michigan Medical School study, published in the February 2006 Journal of Ethnopharmacology, showed that pomegranate seed oil stimulates keratinocyte proliferation, promoting regeneration and strengthening of the epidermis. Pomegranate is also one of the only plant sources of Conjugated Linoleic Acid or CLA.</p>

                    <p><i>Certified Organic Blackberry</i><br />
                    This fantastic antioxidant berry is rich in tannins, gallic acid and high in vitamin C.</p>

                    <p><i>Certified Organic Rosehips</i><br />
                    The fruit of the rose bush, rosehips is one of the most powerful sources of natural vitamin C. Also high in vitamins A, D, E, flavonoids and lycopene.</p>

                    <p><i>Certified Organic Rooibos</i><br />
                    This red tea is known for high antioxidant content. Rooibos is also an effective skin care ingredient due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory abilities.</p>

                    <p><strong>SKIN-IMMUNE TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>

                    <img class="pull-right" alt="Skin Immune Technology Seal" src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/acure/brand-page-acure-about2.jpg"><p>The skin is the largest organ of the human body and one of its major functions is to defend the body from environmental stresses such as UV, chemical irritants, heavy metals and other pollutants. Continuous exposure to these will result in skin irritation followed by decreased barrier function and penetration of the substances in the body.</p>

                    <p>Acure&rsquo;s SKIN-IMMUNE complex moisturizes skin to protect it against environmental stresses through a unique four-phase syste</p>

                    <p>Phase 1. Boost the Phase I and II enzyme ability of the skin, a key part of the skin&rsquo;s immune response, using clinically proven plant stem cells from white horehound.</p>

                    <p>Phase 2. Reduce inflammation with resveratrol probiotics.</p>

                    <p>Phase 3. Minimize bacteria, virus and fungus with olive leaf.</p>

                    <p>Phase 4. Protect and moisturize with argan oil and CoQ10.</p>

                    <p>Look for the patent-pending SKIN-IMMUNE complex in Acure&rsquo;s Day Cream, Night Cream, Radical Wrinkle Complex, Radical Resurfacing and Oil Control Facial Lotion.</p>
