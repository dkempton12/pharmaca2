            <p>Have you ever wondered if the supplements you purchase actually work? With so many brands making so many promises, it’s hard to know whom to trust. Quality of Life doesn’t ask you to take their supplements on faith. Faith is irrelevant when you have research.</p>

            <p>As a company committed to developing evidence-based products, Quality of Life is the only company in the nutritional supplement industry that can make this guarantee:</p>

            <p><strong>Every single ingredient in every one of their products is backed by human studies, and delivered in dosages consistent with clinical research. No exceptions. No compromises.</strong></p>

            <h3>Why Human Studies?</h3>

            <p>“Currently, nine out of ten experimental drugs fail in clinical studies because we cannot accurately predict how they will behave in people based on laboratory and animal studies.”<br />
            <i>—Mike Leavitt, U.S. Secretary of Health & Human Services</i></p>

            <p>While test tube and animal studies may identify promising ingredients worthy of further study, human clinical studies are widely considered the gold standard of scientific research. Why? It’s simply not possible to make foolproof predictions about how substances will function in the human body from test tube or animal studies alone.</p>
            <p>Humans differ from animals in anatomy, physiology and metabolism. Consider these examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chocolate is delicious to you, but poisonous to dogs.</li>
                <li>Tylenol is great for relieving your headache, but it’s toxic to cats.</li>
                <li>Penicillin will help clear up your ear infection, but it will kill a guinea pig.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When you choose Quality of Life, you can trust your supplements to work, because 100 percent of the ingredients in every product they manufacture are backed by human clinical studies.</p>

            <h3>Why Do Dosages Matter?</h3>
            <p>Everyone knows blueberries are a healthy food. Multiple human clinical studies, using about 1 cup per day (about 200 berries), have proven this fact. But what if, in the hopes of getting healthier, you decided to eat a single blueberry a day? Common sense says that eating just one berry daily is unlikely to “keep the doctor away.”</p>
            <p>This is consistent with an accepted principle of both conventional and integrative medicine: Dosages matter. Many natural compounds have been shown to be effective at specific threshold doses, yet have little or no impact at lower ones. Just because eating a daily cup of blueberries is beneficial does not mean that eating one berry a day will have any effect. Unfortunately, it is common practice in the nutritional supplement industry to use dosages of ingredients that are lower than those supported by clinical research.</p>
            <p>When you choose Quality of Life, you can trust your supplements to work, because 100 percent of the ingredients in every product they manufacture contain dosages that match the clinical research.</p>

            <p>“Studies indicate that AHCC supports the immune system by increasing the production of the body’s ‘natural killer cells,’ whose function is to destroy abnormal cells and invading organisms in the body. I recommend AHCC to my patients for both immune support and liver health. The science is undeniable."<br />
            <strong>Paz Eilat, MD</strong> <br />
            <i>Internist<br />
            Sherman Oaks, CA</i></p>

            <p>“As the daughter of a breast cancer survivor, I was extremely motivated to find an herbal solution to augment my mother’s treatment, as well as bolster both of our immune systems. After rigorously investigating available avenues, I concluded that AHCC was the best option. I am happy to report that we are both healthy—and it is 14 years later!”<br />
            <strong>Rebecca Kovan, Ph.D</strong><br />
            <i>Santa Cruz, CA</i></p>

            <p>“As a research scientist in both academia as well as the human and animal industries, I would highly recommend AHCC and would do so over any other nutraceutical on the market for modulating and keeping the immune system strong and functioning for overall health. AHCC is especially important when the system is being stressed by many different diseases and conditions. As an animal scientist, I have used (even on my own pets) as well as recommended to so many the use of AHCC when a pet is suffering from diseases, such as any autoimmune disease and all forms of cancer. Supported by so many hospitals and research studies, I, along with all of my colleagues, have seen AHCC work as a powerful complementary addition to all integrative approaches (i.e., in conjunction with chemotherapy, radiation) and is truly a requirement for full as well as accelerated recovery from surgeries and many life-threatening injuries. I cannot say enough about this incredible compound that I have been using myself for so many years!”<br />
            <strong>Dr. Robert Berger, MS, MVSc, PhD</strong><br />
            <i>Research Biochemist/Pharmacologist<br />
            Loxahatchee, FL</i></p>

            <p>“Being a parent of 5- and 7-year-old boys, I started taking AHCC to protect myself from the many germs and viruses my boys came in contact with at school. AHCC, in combination with probiotics, has made my immune system unbelievably strong!”<br />
            <strong>Mark Becker</strong><br />
            <i>Hermosa Beach, CA</i></p>

            <p>“Active Hexose Correlated Compound is one of my favorite immune enhancing products for my clients and for myself. As a Clinical Nutritionist for more than 15 years, I recommend this Japanese “Superfood” for clients needing support for health issues including: chronic viruses, cancer, liver problems, mood support and just overall wellbeing.”<br />
