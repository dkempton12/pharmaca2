                <hr class="hr-divider" />
            </div>
            <p>Metagenics was founded in 1983 on a brave new scientific concept: that the right nutrition could help people realize their best health possible by influencing what makes them unique—their genes. Back then, Metagenics called it “genetic potential through nutrition.” It also makes them unique—it’s been their mission and a key differentiator ever since.</p>
            <p>Today, this ever-growing and respected field of science is known as nutrigenomics. And it’s been practiced for nearly 30 years by forward-thinking providers who utilize industry-leading products and programs to help people live healthier, happier lives.</p>
            <p>Metagenics’ mission and reputation have attracted the talents of phytochemists, biochemists, medical doctors, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, and other highly respected researchers and clinicians that have been published by numerous domestic and international peer-reviewed journals.</p>
            <p>Using the latest genomic and proteomic research technologies at the Jeffrey S. Bland Science Center, these scientific experts have identified plant-based derivatives and nutrients, including selective kinase response modulators (SKRMs), which positively influence health in uniquely effective and predictably safe ways.</p>
            <p>And they make sure these compounds deliver on their potential by careful examination at every stage—formulation, ingredient selection, quality assays, manufacture, dissolution, taste and tolerance. This is followed by careful examination in their onsite clinic—the Functional Medicine Research Center®—to refine protocols, measure compliance and confirm effectiveness before any proprietary nutraceutical or medical food is introduced to market.</p>
