                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <img class="pull-right" src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/burts-bees/about-1.jpg" alt="About Burt's Bees">
                <p>Most companies look out for the bottom line. Burt’s Bees does, too. In fact, they have a triple bottom line: people, profit, planet. You can't have one without the other two. So when they look after their own, they mean everybody: employees, customers, families, themselves. And yes, our environment, too. Burt’s Bees’ ingredients—right down to the packaging—are simple, natural, and responsible. They practice what they preach—and they hope to set the example for others to follow.</p>
                <p>It's called The Greater Good. And it's how Burt’s is going to help change the world.</p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/burts-bees/about-2.jpg" alt="About Burt's Bees" class="pull-left">
                <p>It was the summer of ’84, and Maine artist Roxanne Quimby was thumbing a ride home (back when you could still do that sort of thing). Eventually a bright yellow Datsun pickup truck pulled over, and Roxanne instantly recognized Burt Shavitz, a local fella whose beard was almost as well-known as his roadside honey stand. Burt and Roxanne hit it off, and before long, Roxanne was making candles with unused wax from Burt’s beehives. They made $200 at their first craft fair; within a year, they’d make $20,000. Pretty auspicious beginning—but just the beginning, all the same.</p>
                <p>From those first candles to the iconic beeswax lip balm we all know today, Burt’s Bees has stayed true to a very simple idea: what you put on your body should be made from the best nature has to offer. They invite you to stick out a thumb and follow them on their uncommon journey—it’s been one heckuva ride. </p>
                <h3>Culture</h3>
                <p>"What's right isn't always popular. What's popular isn't always right." Wise words from one of Burt’s first catalogues, published more than 20 years ago. It's wisdom that continues to inspire them today, and it's why they do things a little differently. No trash cans at their desks, for example. They like a little yoga with lunch. They speak their minds. They help their neighbors. In short, they practice what they preach.</p>
                <p>That's why Burt’s Bees encourages employees to take time off to go do something good for the world. It's why, each year, they hold a Culture Day to promote community outreach—in the past they've planted urban gardens and built hive boxes for the recovering bee population. They encourage wellness through weekly onsite yoga. And through the Greater Good Team, they strive to maintain environmentally friendly practices within the company and alongside their partners.</p>

            <h3>Sustainability Reporting</h3>
            <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/burts-bees/sustainability-image-1.jpg" alt="About Burt's Bees Sustainability" class="pull-right">
            <p>When honeybees want to communicate—to show the location of food, say, or a great new place to live—they perform a waggle dance.</p>
            <p>At Burt’s Bees, they have a waggle dance of their own—it just takes a slightly different form. In the past, they’ve released their own formal reports detailing commitments and goals; the 2012 Sustainability Report was the final report of this kind.</p>
            <p>Since then, they have been included in the integrated financial and sustainability reports of their parent company, The Clorox Company. Their annual reports have been recognized for their transparency and excellence in corporate responsibility reporting.</p>
            <p>In addition, Burt’s Bees is moving towards providing more real-time updates on their progress towards their 2020 sustainability goals both on their website and through social media. This starts with their 2016 Sustainability Goals Update. They look forward to continuing to tell their story.</p> 

            <h3>Operational Footprint</h3>
            <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/burts-bees/sustainability-image-2.jpg" alt="About Burt's Bees Sustainability" class="pull-right">
            <p>Have you ever seen a bee's footprint? Neither have we. All those little gals do is fly from here to there, getting pollen all over everything in their quest for the perfect building material. But they take only what they need—and they leave their environment better than the way they found it.</p>
            <p>At Burt's Bees, they take their cue from nature. They've committed themselves to making the world a little greener, a little cleaner, by doing what bees do best: working hard on natural products that people love.</p>
            <p>That's why, for example, they’ve committed themselves to a policy of sending zero waste to landfill. With more than 350 employees in three facilities, not a single piece of garbage goes to the dump. Not one. Really. How? Each month, employees volunteer to diligently check over 200 recycling, composting and waste-to-energy bins, ensuring everything is sorted properly.</p>
            <p>They're also serious about energy use. They know that purchased electricity is the largest contributor to their carbon footprint—so they've outfitted their facilities with energy-efficient lighting, resource-management software and efficient production equipment. Their conscientious employees look for ways to save energy and water. And they're focusing more on the impact of their supply chain, including contract manufacturers.</p>
            <p>But they also know that, as their brand has grown, so has their water usage, jeopardizing their 2020 sustainability goals. That’s not good enough for them. In the face of global freshwater scarcity and limited non-renewable energy sources, it’s more important than ever to take only what we need.</p>
            <p>So, until they can be fossil fuel-free and water neutral, they’re offsetting their environmental impact in other ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Achieving Carbon Neutral certification from the Natural Capital Partners</li>
                <li>Purchasing Water Restoration Certificates from the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, returning millions of gallons of water—the equivalent of their own consumption—to watersheds like the Colorado River River and the Middle Deschutes Watershed region in Oregon.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>There’s still much to be done, but they’re determined to get there. Because they’re not just creating a better world for us—they’re also doing it for the little yellow and black pollinators who live in harmony with nature, and to whom we owe so much.</p>
