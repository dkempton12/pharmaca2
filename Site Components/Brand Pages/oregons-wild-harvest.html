            <h3>As farmers and manufacturers, Oregon’s Wild Harvest delivers on the promise of environmental stewardship, purity and potency by doing what’s right every day. That means:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Farming their 387-acres following USDA Organic guidelines and practices</li>
                <li>Procuring herbs that can’t be grown on their land from a community of trusted growers who can meet their stringent standards for quality.</li>
                <li>Formulating whole herb products that retain the life, energy and vitality from nature. They believe the whole plant has everything you need.</li>
                <li>Encouraging diversity—on their land, in the workplace and within their community.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>When you choose Oregon’s Wild Harvest, you will feel good knowing…</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>That they’re an independent, family-owned and operated company that’s in it for the long haul!</li>
                    <li>They collect and replant our organic seeds. These seeds will become a source for quality medicinal plants for generations to come.</li>
                    <li>Every one of their products are scientifically tested to ensure quality and purity. In fact, their standards for quality control exceed those required by the FDA and their certifiers.</li>
                    <li>Their encapsulated herbal supplements are free of flowing agents like silicon dioxide and magnesium stearate.</li>
