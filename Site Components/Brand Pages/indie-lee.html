            <p>Brain tumor survivor and lover of life Indie Lee launched her line of clean skin care in 2009. Her collection of clean beauty products is designed to enhance your natural beauty while awakening the mind, body and soul. We talked to Indie about how she got her start in skin care.   </p>
                
            <h2>The brand is grounded in nature, supported through science, inspired by life. What do these three pillars mean to you and for the brand?</h2>
                
            <p>Indie Lee has always been rooted in nature. We began with ingredients grown in my greenhouse and today, we’re using science to elevate these gifts from Mother Nature. Everything we do through these two pillars is inspired by my second chance at life, and with the intent to inspire people to live their best life. </p>
                
            <h2>Earth Day is an important celebration for you, and for Indie Lee brand.  What does Earth Day represent to you this year?</h2>    

            <p>Yes—it’s a big day for both me and the brand. For those that don’t already know, Earth Day is also my “Re-Birthday,” the day I woke up from successful brain surgery. This year, Earth Day is all about renewal. For me, it’s always a time of reflection and it’s interesting to see how I've evolved as a founder/CEO, as a person, as a mother. So, it's only natural that the brand evolve as well. I've always embraced change and this year is all about the next step of evolution for the brand. It may be a little cliche, but that being said, I think the best is yet to come.</p>    
                
                    
            <h2>How did you go about starting a skin care business? Do you have previous experience with plants that has helped guide your concept for the brand?</h2>  
            
                
            <p>When I was diagnosed with a potentially fatal brain tumor and asked how this is possible, the doctor explained that it could be environmental and asked me “What do you put on your skin?” The truth was I had no idea what I was putting on my skin—but that was my awakening. I knew this was my purpose, my role was to create change and provide healthier options.</p>

            <p>I’m an avid gardener. In fact, I have a 750-square-foot greenhouse in my backyard (and yes, the rumors are true, it has a crystal chandelier). I was creating products using ingredients grown in my greenhouse long before I even considered launching the line. I've always been a DIYer and when I found myself with an abundance of ingredients, I started creating and concocting. While our products are no longer sourced and created from my greenhouse, its role in the brand still carries over to our formulation process today.</p>    
                
            <h2>What’s your formulation process like? How do you identify and test new ingredients?</h2>    
                
            <p>My personal thirst for constant learning and seeking out new ingredients had led me to some of the world’s best chemists and formulators. We actively listen to our community, what they want and need, and what fits their lifestyle. We work to formulate products that provide with the best version of what they’re seeking.</p>   
                
            <h2>What are your favorite Indie Lee products?</h2>    

            <p>It’s so hard to choose just one! It’s like asking which is my favorite child. I do have an extra soft spot for the Brightening Cleanser. It heroes lycopene from tomatoes and hydrolyzed wheat protein to create multi-tasking magic—cleansing, hydrating, firming and controlling complexion. It also duals as an exfoliating mask—just leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes before rinsing!</p>
            
            <p>I also can't live without the CoQ-10 Toner. It's formulated with the antioxidant powerhouse CoQ-10, as well as aloe vera and hyaluronic acid that hydrate, cool and balance the pH levels of the skin. It's also alcohol-free so it won't dry out the skin. I love tossing this in my gym bag with a few cotton rounds for a quick cleaning and cooling routine post-workout.</p>  
                
            <h2>What is the mission and culture like at Indie Lee? Any initiatives you’re especially proud of?</h2>   
                
            <p>Our mission and culture has always been rooted in self-empowerment through education. Having access to choices allows us all to take control of our own wellbeing—mind, body and soul. I’m extremely proud of how hard our team has worked to bring a collection of products to market that make these choices so accessible.</p>  
                
            <h2>Finally, why did you decide to partner with Pharmaca?</h2> 
                
            <p>Pharmaca carries such a thoughtful selection of clean products and we’re so excited to be a part of it. It can be intimidating and confusing to shop clean beauty and the Pharmaca team has done an incredible job curating some of the best clean products on the market. Pharmaca also carries so many of the products that I personally use, like Vapour, <i>jane iredale</i> and Vital Proteins, just to name a few.</p>
