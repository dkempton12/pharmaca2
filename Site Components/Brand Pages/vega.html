                <p>Good for your body and the planet, Vega is the clean, plant-based choice to fuel your healthy, active lifestyle—without compromise. Formulated by Brendan Brazier: vegan, professional Ironman triathlete, nutrition coach and best-selling author of the Thrive series on plant-based nutrition. Vega’s award-winning products include Vega One All-in-One Nutritional Shake and Vega Sport, the first complete, all-natural, three-stage sport performance system.</p>
                <h3>What you eat should provide energy, not drain it</h3>
                <p>Since 2001, Vega has established itself as a leader in the plant-based natural health and performance products industry. Born from the belief that you shouldn’t have to choose between clean, plant-based nutrition and on-the-go convenience, Vega is guided by the idea that alkaline-forming, plant-based whole foods are the true future of optimal health—and that nutrition is the foundation from which to build a stronger, younger-feeling body.</p>
                <h3>Plant-based power for everyday superheroes</h3>
                <p>Proudly recognized as one of the fastest growing and best companies to work for in Canada, Vega’s performance is driven by core values centered around sustainability, integrity, entrepreneurship and ‘walking the talk.’ Vega's goal is to provide ecologically friendly, premium natural health solutions that have minimal impacts on the planet. Vega’s commitment to sustainability starts with ingredients that are plant-based, locally grown, minimally processed and also non-GMO and organic where available.</p>
                <p>As a lifestyle brand, Vega has established a deep connection with passionate brand ambassadors across the continent, including celebrities, professional and Olympic athletes, health practitioners and raving consumer fans that all share a common belief that clean plant-based nutrition can help you achieve your health and performance goals.</p>
