                <p>Bucky Products has been a Seattle-based company for more than 20 years. Founded in 1992, Bucky was created to make life more comfortable. Inspired by traditional pillows from Eastern Europe and Asia, these items are quality pieces, thoughtfully designed to ease travel and create an oasis of calm and luxurious comfort anywhere. All of Bucky’s products were engineered—and most are still made—in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
                
                <p>Bucky’s first product was the U-Shaped Travel Pillow, which answered the need for comfort during travel. The Utopia combined the ingenuity of a buckwheat hull filling with a unique u-shaped pillow design.</p>
                
                <p>From these humble beginnings, Bucky’s offerings have expanded and evolved to encompass every aspect of comfort. From generously sized Hot/Cold Therapy packs to portable luxurious travel goods, Bucky’s commitment is to create quality, long-lasting comforts that make life less stressful.</p>
