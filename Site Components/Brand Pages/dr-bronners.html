                <p>Dr. Bronner’s was founded in 1948 by Emanuel Bronner, a third-generation master soapmaker from a German-Jewish family. He used the labels on his superb ecological soaps to spread his message that we must realize our transcendent unity across religious and ethnic divides or perish: “We are All-One or None!” Dr. Bronner’s honors that same vision today by making socially and environmentally responsible products of the highest quality, and by dedicating profits to help make a better world. All-One!</p>

                <p>Emanuel Bronner believed that a company has a responsibility to “Share the profits with the workers and the earth from which you made it!” His son Ralph called this approach Constructive Capitalism and Dr. Bronner’s practices it in every aspect of the business—from the products they make, throughout their supply chains, to their dedicated activism and charitable giving, to their relationships with employees, customers and suppliers. It’s important that Dr. Bronner’s products have a real and positive impact on the people and communities worldwide that make them.</p>

                <p>Dr. Bronner’s products are of the highest quality, meeting the strictest ethical and environmental standards. No synthetics, no harsh chemicals (none!). Only the purest organic, Fair Trade, cruelty-free and biodegradable ingredients. And most products are vegan and certified to the same organic standards as food.</p>
