                <hr class="hr-divider" />
            </div>
            <p>NeuroScience, Inc. was established in the Saint Croix River Valley near Osceola, Wisc. in 2000 as a privately owned professional-grade dietary supplement company. They began offering proprietary blends of amino acids designed specifically to move objectively measured laboratory nervous system biomarkers called neurotransmitters.</p>
            <p>After nearly two decades, NeuroScience is recognized as a top professional-grade brand delivering premium products containing amino acids, botanicals, vitamins and minerals exclusively to thousands of active health care providers throughout the United States and around the world.</p>
            <p>NeuroScience helped pioneer the concept of neuro-adrenal-supporting supplements in the 2000s and is a contemporary leader in products designed to support healthy sleep-wake cycles.</p>
            <h3>Consistent Products, Consistent Results</h3>
            <p>NeuroScience embraces the expectations of a rigorously regulated professional-grade supplement brand. In addition to using FDA-inspected manufacturers that are cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) compliant, NeuroScience orders impartial third-party testing to verify label ingredient amounts are met, inspect for microbial contaminants and test for heavy metal contamination. They believe their comprehensive Quality Management System ensures consistent products that deliver consistent results.</p>

                    <p><i>Contains a blend of ingredients involved in the synthesis and activity of GABA, a neurotransmitter important for sleep*</i></p>
                    <p>GABA is the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, meaning its central role is to balance excitability of neurons. Because of its function, GABA is important for promoting sleep, and calm and managing stress. Stress is thought to alter GABA synthesis and activity by affecting the expression of GABA-synthesizing enzymes and receptors.</p>

                    <p>The addition of ingredients such as taurine and vitamin B6 are important for glutamate-GABA balance.* High glutamate can damage neurons, alter cellular homeostasis and cause mitochondrial dysfunction, which can ultimately lead to cell death. Taurine demonstrates GABA-A agonist activity and protects neurons and mitochondria against glutamate-induced damage.* The active form of vitamin B6 is important for the synthesis of GABA as it is a required co-factor for glutamate decarboxylase, the enzyme responsible for converting glutamate to GABA.*</p>

                    <p><i>This blend is shown to improve the onset and quality of sleep, and provides the strongest sleep support among Kavinace products*</i></p>
                    <p>The effects of Kavinace Ultra PM have been studied in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. One capsule of Kavinace Ultra PM taken at bedtime for 5 days significantly improved quality of sleep as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.* Participants taking Kavinace Ultra PM reported decreased time to fall asleep, increased duration of sleep and decreased sleep disturbances.*</p>

                    <p><i>Contains ingredients shown to improve sleep and cognitive function*</i></p>
                    <p>In this formula, Kavinace is combined with ZembrinÂ®, a standardized extract from the botanical Sceletium tortuosom. Zembrin works by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) and serotonin transporters.* In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, Zembrin significantly improved onset of sleep and cognitive function.* Blueberry fruit extract is a source of anthocyanins, which are flavonoids with strong antioxidant properties and have been shown to increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor important for maintaining neuron function.*</p>

                    <p><i>Contains ingredients shown to improve sleep and reduce vasomotor symptoms*</i></p>
                    <p>In this formula, Kavinace is combined with 5-HTP, a precursor to serotonin. Serotonin is important for modifying the thermoregulatory set point. This means supporting serotonin may help to ameliorate hot flashes. Kavinace Flash-Ease also contains two botanicals with serotonergic activity, ashwagandha and black cohosh.* Ashwagandha supports a healthy stress response, while black cohosh exhibits GABAergic and potentially selective estrogenic activity.* In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, black cohosh significantly reduced vasomotor symptoms, improved sleep quality and reduced wakefulness after falling asleep.*</p>
