        <p>Bottega Organica's 100% organic, all-natural skin care concept was born in 2013 from Dr. Alimonti’s pivotal scientific discovery on the powerful ant-aging effects of salvia haenkei.</p>

        <p>Dr. Andrea Alimonti, a world-renowned geneticist, screened thousands of different plants for their ability to maintain human cells in a youthful state. He was ultimately able to identify a handful of plant extracts with intense anti-aging action, but salvia haenkei, also known as prawn sage, was by far the most active extract—and is now the backbone of the Bottega Organica skin care line.</p>
        <p>Dr. Alimonti’s research on salvia haenkei is published in the December 2016 issue of the US scientific journal Aging, in an article entitled Identification of Salvia haenkei as gerosuppressant agent by using an integrated senescence-screening assay.</p>

        <p><i>“The most potent of these hits was an extract of Salvia haenkei (SH), a member of the family of Salvias, native of Bolivia. SH decreased senescence by 50%…”</i></p> 

        <p>Everything that goes into Bottega Organica products is well-researched and meticulously crafted. All Bottega Organica ingredients are harvested and processed naturally from farms in Italy—straight from farm to bottle. You won’t find any preservatives, emulsifiers, artificial fragrances, colors or synthetics of any kind.</p>
