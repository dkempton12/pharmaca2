            <p>Created from the finest of natural ingredients, Pré de Provence products are meticulously fashioned in Provence by French artisans following traditions established generations ago. Extreme pride and care are the foundation for everything Pre de Provence creates, upholding the quality, artistry and authenticity demanded of products “Made in France.”</p>

            <p>Nature casts a magical spell on a certain haven in southern France, nestled between sky-reaching mountains and the Mediterranean Sea. The skies shine blue, endless mineral-rich waters sparkle and verdant meadows abound with fragrant treasures of lavender, wildflowers, herbs, fruits and vegetables. Just breathing the wonderful scents in the air brings peace and tranquility.</p>

            <p>It is these fragrances they infuse into their products so that you may experience this magic of Provence. Pamper yourself with a full range of skin-nourishing bath and body products created using the purest vegetable ingredients, rich shea butter, organic argan oil or even sun-cured sea salt.</p>

            <p>Experiencing natural beauty should be an everyday, affordable luxury. And every product should be as authentically French as Pré de Provence.</p>

            <h3>Not all French Soaps are Created Equal</h3>
            <img src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/pre-de-provence/soaps.jpg" alt="Pre de Provence Soaps" class="img-responsive pull-left">
            <p>For centuries, the luxury of French-milled soaps has remained the gold standard of excellence. Each time you begin to lather a French made soap, you enter a time and place where quality and craftsmanship have stood still. Traditional French soap is triple-milled to produce a completely uniform and smooth soap, without impurities, thus lasting longer.</p>

            <p>Every bar of Pré de Provence soap is not only carefully made today by dedicated soapmakers in Provence following their proud traditions, but quad-milled to be smoother and have a richer lather to create a luxurious feel.</p>

            <p>Using all pure, natural ingredients enriched with shea butter, you can feel the difference made by their unique quad-milling process. Aromatic fragrances transport you to a moment of calmness, vitality, dreaming or wellbeing.</p>
