            <p>In just a few short years, One Love Organics has become a cult skin care favorite. Made in small batches on St. Simons Island, GA, the company was the brainchild of Suzanne Leroux, a former laywer. Here’s how Suzanne—who now runs the biz with husband Chase—got into the natural beauty business to begin with.</p>
            <h3>You used to be an attorney…how did you parlay that into a career creating organic skin care?</h3>

            <p>I have always loved beauty products. Beauty products have always been my first choice as a treat. I love how I feel after treating myself to a treatment, new product or even just performing my daily beauty ritual. I delight in the textures, the scents and the packaging of beauty products.</p>
            <p>Over time, I discovered a really strong desire to learn as much as I could about ingredients and how I could make beauty products with the highest grade and healthiest ingredients possible. In fact, the day my husband called for our first date was the same day my first set of essential oils arrived for my studies in aromatherapy. Over the next 10 years, I studied aromatherapy, herbology, cosmetic chemistry and holistic skin care. From there, I created natural beauty products. What I was doing created a bit of overwhelm for me balancing my full-time career with my passion for skin care, so my husband suggested I pursue my passion full-time. One Love Organics is really a labor of love for me.</p>
            <h3>Why are vitamins so important in your skin care philosophy?</h3>

            <p>The single biggest cause of aging and dull skin is caused by free radical damage. Solar UV rays and environmental stressors produce free radicals in the skin and that can damage the skin and accelerate the aging process. They are the main instigators behind fine lines, wrinkles, sagging, hyperpigmentation ... and even skin cancer.</p>
            <p>Antioxidants are nature's defense against free radicals. Plant-powered antioxidants—for example, green tea, sea buckthorn, and vitamins A, C and E—are natural compounds that help to combat the destructive nature of free radicals. Antioxidants can help minimize the effects of and damage caused by free radicals so we believe that using topical skin care rich in vitamins and antioxidants ensures that you have the healthiest glow possible.</p>
            <h3>You are based in Georgia, where it seems like the concept of natural beauty is still catching on…do you find that to be a challenge? Do you see more lines like yours cropping up in the region?</h3>
            <p>Yes, it is still catching on in Georgia and we are honored to be a part of that education and transformation. Our community has really embraced what we are doing and, being in a rural area, many people are excited at the possibility of expansion and job creation. Everyone is super supportive of what we are doing with our business.</p>

            <p>Three years ago, we earned the license to manufacture natural and organic cosmetics under ECOCERT ® standards. One Love Organics now owns the only ECOCERT® licensed manufacturing facility for natural and organic cosmetics in the state of Georgia and is 1 of only 10 facilities licensed in the United States. So it is new and exciting for everyone. But there are other great natural and organic brands in Georgia, including Atlanta-based brands Hollybeth Organics and Little Barn Apothecary.</p>
            <h3>What drew you to Pharmaca as a retailer?</h3>
            <img src="media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/one-love-organics/one-love-spray.jpg" alt="One Love Organics Spray Bottle" class="img-responsive pull-right">
            <p>I personally love shopping at Pharmaca. No trip to Boulder for me was ever complete without a trip to Pharmaca, so it was a dream come true to have my brand featured on its shelves. The healthy treats, drinks, supplements and skin care made it a must-stop for me and my two boys. I also believe strongly in holistic care for the skin to look its best, so I use supplements like magnesium and Gaia Herbs Thyroid Support (the thyroid helps regulate dry skin). I love that at Pharmaca I can pick those up along with my makeup and skin care!</p>
