                <h3>About Erbaviva’s founders, voyagers for organic</h3>
            
                <img src="media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/erbaviva/brand-page-erbaviva-about-robin-brown.jpg" alt="Erbaviva Robin Brown Profile Picture" class="pull-left" />
            
                <p>With a passion for pure ingredients and their own children as inspiration, Robin Brown and Anna Cirronis created Erbaviva, a beautiful line of authentically organic skin care products. In the defining spirit of voyagers, Robin and Anna were among the very first to seek out and source the highest quality organic ingredients possible for their original organic baby skin care line in 1996.</p>
                <p>Desiring the healthiest, safest and most natural products for their newborn, the couple developed distinctively pure products, consciously crafted with nourishing living herbs and botanicals and free from harsh detergents, chemical fragrances and other unhealthy additives. And so Erbaviva was born.</p>

                <h3>WHY ORGANIC?</h3>
                
                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                
                <p>The average woman absorbs 2 kg of chemicals into her body from conventional cosmetics every year! And the average child is exposed through conventional body care products to at least 27 chemicals a day, including some associated with cancer, brain and nervous system damage, allergies and hormone disruption.<p>
                
                <h4>The Solution</h4>
                
                <p>Organic is a far higher standard than “natural,” since natural ingredients can still contain residual pesticides, chemicals and additives.</p>
                <p>True organic products are free of dangerous pesticides, artificial fertilizers and other toxic chemicals including parabens, phthalates, sulfates, PEGs and other endocrine disruptors.</p>
                
                <h3>WHY ERBAVIVA ORGANIC?</h3> 
                
                <p>Erbaviva is proud to be among the trendsetters in the world of organic personal care, adhering to the highest standards of ingredients, developmental processes and sustainability.</p>

                        <p>Products carrying the highly stringent USDA Certified Organic seal contain 95% or more certified organic ingredients, resulting in safe products that are almost edible! In order to comply with these standards, personal care products must meet the same organic certification requirements as food.</p>

                <p>Erbaviva remains ever true to its original philosophy of authenticity and enduring commitment to people and the environment with its products, manufacturing and global community service.</p>
                
                <p>Erbaviva is a proud financial supporter of The BlinkNow Foundation and its invaluable work to sustain and care for the lives of impoverished children. Maggie Doyne, founder of BlinkNow, was just out of high school when she went on a journey through the Himalayas that compelled her to create the Kopila Valley Children’s Home and School. Kopila has become a caring home for more than 50 children, and a thriving school for more than 350 students. Maggie Doyne was recently named the 2015 CNN Hero of the Year and was presented with the Unsung Heroes of Compassion award by the Dalai Lama.</p>

                    <p>We’ve been extremely lucky to have Erbaviva as partners and friends. Through our partnership and collaborations we’ve been able to implement sustainable projects to support our children’s home, school, and women’s center in Nepal. We’ve done everything from purchase a mommy and baby cow, to biodynamic farming, and provide art therapy and counseling services for our children, and provide entrepreneurial skills to women and mothers in our community. We love Erbaviva’s devotion to the environment, and their focus on building community and a better world and feel lucky to be one of recipients to the generosity and love they spread throughout the world. The owners and entire team themselves are wonderful people who live the values they expound through their business.</p>

                <p>In addition, Erbaviva’s unique handcrafted fabric packaging and basketry is purchased through Sop Moei Arts, an artisan support project that provides direct financial benefit to the Pwo Karen hill tribe of Northern Thailand and Burma. Sop Moei Arts also helps the tribe run a mobile children’s clinic and works with the community to transition away from the region’s traditional “slash and burn” agricultural practices to creating permanent, sustainable farms.</p>
