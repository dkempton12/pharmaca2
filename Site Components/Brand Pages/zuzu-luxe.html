                <p>Drawing from his grandmother&rsquo;s homeopathic practices and teachings, Gabriel DeSantino, CEO and Founder of Gabriel Cosmetics, Inc. has always believed that the sea embodies special healing and revitalizing properties.</p>

                <p>As a young child, Gabriel frequented his grandmother&rsquo;s home near the coast of Mexico where he learned the significance of seaweed and kelp. As his curiosity heightened and his passion for healthy living and natural beauty developed, he knew it was his calling to bring these special properties to the forefront and become an advocate for all-natural and organic beauty products.</p>

                <p>Gabriel began his beauty empire in 1992, drawing from his grandmother&rsquo;s wisdom to create the vegan and gluten-free Gabriel Skincare line, full of sea-derived ingredients. By 2001 he had launched ZuZu Luxe by Gabriel Cosmetics, an all-natural, vegan and gluten free makeup collection. Gabriel later introduced Clean Kids Naturally to round out his all-natural beauty collection, offering products for every age.</p>

                <p>Gabriel Skincare evolved into what is now Gabriel Organics after receiving USDA/Organic certification in 2011. Through consistent research, product development and direct consumer interaction, Gabriel keeps his finger on the pulse of new healthy beauty developments and continues to be one of the leaders in the natural beauty movement.</p>
