            <p><strong>MegaFood</strong> is a pioneer in the natural products industry, as the first company to make vitamins from scratch. For 40 years, they have been making wholesome nutritional supplements that deliver the nutrition of farm fresh foods.</p>
            <p>Founded in 1973, MegaFood's mission has always been to produce superior whole food supplements for those who care about their health and wellbeing. Over the years they have produced a number of award-winning supplements including Blood Builder, Women Over 40 One Daily, MegaFlora, Kid's One Daily and the Vegan collection.</p>
            <h3>Fresh from Farm To Tablet</h3>
            <p>To make dietary supplements that provide the most authentic nourishment possible, MegaFood first begins by sourcing fruits, vegetables and whole grains from their Farm Fresh Farm Partners throughout the United States and Canada. They work with family-owned farms known for their commitment to growing with care and ethical farming practices. Each season they rigorously examine their freshly harvested foods for quality before sending them through the one-of-kind Slo-Food Process.</p>
            <h3>The Slo-Food Process</h3>
            <p>The best way to consume essential vitamins and minerals is by eating a variety of fresh, colorful foods&mdash;fruits, vegetables and whole grains. MegaFood starts with fresh, ripe-harvested whole foods that provide customers with a broad array of essential vitamins, minerals and micro-nutrients, just as nature intended.</p>
            <p>But standard manufacturing processes can destroy many of the delicate phytonutrients that play a key role in supporting health. That's why MegaFood partnered with researchers at the University of New Hampshire to develop the unique Slo-Food Process. Just as the name implies, the process is a slower, gentler way of optimizing the potency of a vitamin or mineral within the phytonutrient-rich whole foods chosen.</p>
            <p>The foods they use are sourced from farms as close to home as possible and are delivered fresh frozen to the doorstep of their manufacturing facility in Londonderry, NH. Here these foods are cold-milled to help break down indigestible plant fibers and enhance digestibility, natural enzymatic pre-digestion to improve bioavailability and gentle drying to maximize nutrient retention. Heat-free tableting and glass bottles ensure that the foods are as nutrient rich when they reach the customer as they were when they were delivered to us in their fresh, raw form.</p>
            <h3>Authentic Nourishment</h3>
            <img class="pull-left" src="/media/wysiwyg/brands/pages/megafood/brand-pages-megafood-about2.jpg" alt="Authentic Nourishment Image"/>
            <p>MegaFood's supplements get their nourishment from a variety of foods, including fresh carrots for mixed carotenoids, broccoli for folate, whole green cabbage for vitamin K, oranges for vitamin C, organic brown rice for vitamin E, antioxidant-rich fruits like cranberries and blueberries for protective phenolic compounds, and nutritional yeast for B vitamins and minerals.</p>
            <p>There are many other vitamins to choose from, but no other whole food supplement company makes their own nutrients, or sources as many fresh foods, as MegaFood does.</p>
